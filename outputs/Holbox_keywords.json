We ordered the scallop taco, octopus taco, smoked kanpachi taco, Baja fish taco, and the aguachile with spot prawn and scallops. The scallop was buttery and sweet, the octopus was super tender with that perfect char, and the smoked kanpachi had this deep, smoky flavor that was just insane. The aguachile was bright, spicy, and refreshing—perfect for a warm day.\n\nThe service was exceptional. You order at the counter, and they somehow manage to bring everything out quickly and perfectly timed, even with so many tables scattered around the market. It’s impressive how smoothly everything runs.\n\nWe finished with the churros and chocolate sauce, which were the perfect ending—crispy, light, and the chocolate was rich but not overly sweet.\n\nThe small lot is paid (about $4 an hour), but there’s some free street parking if you get lucky.

It was only about 28 miles, but I spent almost two hours to arrive at Holbox. I don't know why the traffic was so horrible that day, or maybe it was just as normal as every day.\n\nFor friends who know me, I don't go to fine dining frequently. I had too much fine dining back in Shanghai. I'd rather find interesting dining spots--inside food courts, at food trucks, etc. Holbox is a Michelin one-star restaurant, but not pricey. Even though it's in a food court and not a traditional restaurant, it's interesting. The food booth doesn't have its own tables in the food court; they're shared with others.\n\nIt's a Mexican food booth. The boss lady--puebla in Spanish--was tough, but not rude. As with most Michelin spots, there was a queue, but it wasn't too long. I grabbed a table stand and found us a place to sit.\n\nNot long after, the food was served. The free tortilla chips had no shining points--just as normal as in every Mexican restaurant. Crispy, flat dipping, better than nothing. Good for snacking after a long drive.\n\nThe food was served one by one, or you could say delivered one by one:\n\nErizo 5/5\nThe word erizo in Spanish means hedgehog, but it can also mean sea urchin. They actually look quite similar. Basically, it's sea urchin. Not everyone likes it--some love it, some hate it. I'm a big fan, uni in Japanese. There were two sea urchins, each with about four or five roes. Underneath were fish and scallop ceviches, but different from normal ceviche--it was lighter, without vinegar or lemon taste, more pure raw seafood. I liked it. Not cheap at $27 for an appetizer.\n\nTaco de Pulpo en su Tinta (Octopus Taco) 5/5\nBasically, it's an octopus taco, mixed with squid ink or cuttlefish in--I couldn't tell. The ink mostly gave it color, with just a faint hint of the sea for flavor. Each taco had a giant octopus tentacle--three tacos on a plate, one tentacle for each. The texture was excellen--soft, tender, not juicy but still moist, not fishy at all. I bet the octopus was stewed for a long time, which made it so tasty. Very good. $7 for three, which I wouldn't call expensive--actually well priced.\n\nPescado a las Brasas 5/5\nFish, who doesn't like fish? A few-bone fish, no tiny bones. The seabass had only one big bone but no tiny bones between the muscles. It was grilled seabass, not heavily marinated but well seasoned. The freshness was its biggest strength.\n\nCilantro Rice and Black Beans 5/5\nThe rice was served with the grilled seabass, dipped in stewed black beans. I had never tried that before, but it was tasty. Not too much cilantro aroma, but still good. The rice itself was perfectly cooked--grains separated, not sticky. Paired with the black beans, it was a great match.\n\nI recommend this food booth in the food court, not only because of its Michelin crown, but also for the way they used squid/cuttlefish ink, how they treated cilantro, lemon, and avocado. They truly put heart into making good food.

The standouts were the tostada, uni, smoked Kanpachi taco, and the grilled lobster. The Uni was fresh and buttery, served in its shell with scallop and an aioli-like sauce of somekind, mouthwatering. Lobster was grilled evenly, pre broken, served with melted butter, avocado tomatoes, and what can go wrong with a live lobster? Nothing, and they weighed the lobster in front of us, let us snap photos despite being so busy which was sweet of them.

Located inside a food hall, the line can stretch out the door depending on when you arrive, but the counter service setup moves efficiently.\n\nWe ordered: Tostada de Kanpachi & Uni, Sea Urchin, Scallop Aguachile, Smoked Kanpachi Taco, Taco de Pulpo, Blood Clams, and Langosta al Carbón.\n\nEverything was fresh and delicious. The standouts were the tostada, uni, smoked Kanpachi taco, and the grilled lobster. The Uni was fresh and buttery, served in its shell with scallop and an aioli-like sauce of somekind, mouthwatering. Lobster was grilled evenly, pre broken, served with melted butter, avocado tomatoes, and what can go wrong with a live lobster? Nothing, and they weighed the lobster in front of us, let us snap photos despite being so busy which was sweet of them.

I found an empty seat and took advantage. It's located in a food court, so expect a packed house.\n\nI was helped quickly by a gentleman. I started off with a sparkling lemonade and a taco de pulpo en su tinta. The taco was very good. The octopus was tender and went well with the calamari ink sofrito. Next I got a tostada de atun. Bluefin tuna, avocado puree and arbol peanut sauce. The combination of all 3 were great! And the homemade tostada was easy to eat. Didn't crumble at any bites, so you're enjoying every component of the plate. Lastly, I got an entrée of pulpo a la brasa. The smokiness of the octopus combined with the almond pipian was spot-on! Combine that to make a taco with the baby tomatoes and avocado slices it was a perfect combo!\n\nOverall, a great experience at $57.00. The server was attentive, although his attitude changed after my 15% tip. It's all good. Doesn't take away from the overall experience. I highly recommend coming here.

It is good to use your wait time in the long line to the ordering counter wisely. Send others to grab drinks from another vendor. Buy a few tacos from another vendor if you are hungry.\n\nWe tried a lot of dishes. The Baja shrimp taco is traditional, but the shrimp are huge and moist, and the crema and toppings are great. Also quite good was the tostado de jurel. It is yellowtail ceviche, avocado, and an almond salsa on a very crispy corn tortilla base. It was fresh, sour, savory, and yummy.

Octopus was tasty moist and soft, the seabass was perfectly grilled that you can lift the fillet off the bone in one piece.  The corn tortillas were soft and fresh.  Nice. Not cheap but well worth it.\nThe place actually is a food court with other food stalls so don’t go to the wrong counter, seating is shared and don’t expect table cloths or linen.\nWent there again for lunch before the basketball game .

                    "Context": "We drove all the way from Lake Forest to try Hobox, recently awarded a Michelin star, and located in a food court. There was a line stretching to the door, but it moved fairly quickly. After ordering, we grabbed a number and found a seat by the door. Unfortunately, things took a turn when the line was moved inside, right next to our table. It was loud and awkward to eat with people standing so close, so we had to relocate mid-meal. Thankfully, shortly after we moved, they relocated the line back outside to address the same concerns other diners had.\n\nAs for the food, we started with the sparkling lemonade, which was wonderfully bubbly with a perfectly balanced sweet and acidic flavor. It tasted freshly squeezed with no artificial coloring, giving it a very homemade feel.\n\nNext, we received complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were freshly fried and crunchy, but the salsa was a bit too acidic for my taste.\n\nWe ordered the uni and kanpachi tostada, which had simple yet effective flavors of salt, pepper, and lime juice that allowed the freshness of the fish and uni to really shine.\n\nThe ceviche mixto had a similar flavor profile—salt, pepper, lime juice, finely chopped onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and a mix of fresh fish, shrimp, and octopus. While the seafood was undeniably fresh, I found it too salty and lacking in umami. A touch of sweetness and more depth would have made it more enjoyable. The tostada that accompanied the ceviche was light, airy, and perfectly crunchy—not your typical tostada, which was a nice surprise.\n\nFor the tacos, the scallop tacos were absolutely delicious. The scallops were tender, and the pickled onions and grilled cherry tomatoes added just the right amount of acidity to balance the dish. The octopus tacos were the highlight. Perfectly cooked octopus paired with calamari ink sofrito created an unforgettable dish—one of the best octopus taco I’ve ever had.

The octopus was tender and perfectly cooked, enhanced by the rich, savory calamari ink sofrito. The depth of flavor in this dish was outstanding, with each bite revealing a nuanced blend of textures and tastes that truly highlighted the quality of the ingredients.\n\nNext, I indulged in the Scallop taco, a masterpiece of pan-seared Maine diver scallops. The scallops were succulent and cooked to perfection, accompanied by a vibrant salsa \"x'catic\" that added a touch of heat. The caramelized onions, tomato, and marinated fennel provided a sweet and tangy contrast, elevating the overall flavor profile of the dish. The combination of these elements created a harmonious and sophisticated taste that lingered pleasantly on the palate.\n\nThe Cóctel mixto was another highlight, featuring a mix of wild Mexican shrimp, Gulf of Mexico octopus, and Baja bay scallop. The seafood was fresh and succulent, and the house-made sweet and sour cocktail sauce added a refreshing and zesty touch. The balance of sweetness and acidity in the sauce complemented the natural flavors of the seafood beautifully, making this dish a refreshing and satisfying option.\n\nThe ambiance at Holbox is charming and laid-back, set within the vibrant environment of Mercado la Paloma. The market itself is a treasure trove of cultural experiences, offering a diverse array of food choices. It's a great place to explore and soak in the rich cultural tapestry of Los Angeles.\n\nHolbox's approach to customer service is unique, with a casual system where food and drinks are dropped off at your table, rather than traditional waiter service. This setup adds to the relaxed atmosphere, allowing diners to enjoy their meal at their own pace without the formality of a traditional restaurant.\n\nOverall, my experience at Holbox was delightful. Each dish showcased a thoughtful blend of high-quality ingredients and innovative flavors, making it clear why this establishment has earned a Michelin star. The ambiance and service add to the experience, making it a must-visit for anyone looking to explore the rich culinary landscape of Los Angeles.

The fish is premium quality and melt-in your mouth and the exact right amount of citrus to spice.\n\nAtun Tostada (Tuna Ceviche) - 7/10 - Good. The fish is very fresh but the flavor profile of the ceviche mix can use some work. Also, I am a seafood lover and the white-ish sauce paired with the tuna looked unappealing at first presentation, even to me.\n\nTaco de Pulpo en su Tinta (Braised Octopus taco)  - 0/10 - Disgusting!!!! So gross the lingering flavor was making me nauseous on the ride home. (Note: Ive eaten octopus many times - I tried this based on many good experiences). You get a big tortilla with just a piece of crisped (bland) octopus that tasted old and had an extremely gamey flavor. I hated this. Regret ordering it.\n\nScallop Taco - 1/10 - A throwaway dish undeserving of the good money paid for it. Turns out Scallops don’t belong in tacos. Being such a novelty I just had to try it. Huge mistake. Again, the tortilla to filling ratio was way off. All I could taste was bread. The scallops were extremely bland, had a boiled texture - no sear, no char. With only 2 scallops in a thick tortilla, it was like they weren’t even there. Such a waste of perfectly good scallops. Hated this.\n\nAll 3 stars are for the ceviches (tostadas). The cooked seafood is so awful I am insulted I was charged money for them as I feel I should be paid for the trouble of eating them.

The smoked kampachi taco had a cool concept, but wasn’t something either of us wanted more than a bite of. The Baja shrimp taco? That one was solid—but LA is a city of incredible tacos. If you’re going to be one of the top taco spots here, you really have to bring it. Holbox didn’t.\n\nThe ceviche was the one bright spot in terms of taste. The fish was fresh and well-marinated, but it was plated in a way that felt messy and overwhelming. The portion was huge and oddly presented—more cafeteria scoop than culinary elegance.\n\nThe fryer oil was another surprise. I have a soybean allergy—to boot—so I couldn’t even try some of the items, including the chips and fish tacos I was most excited about. They use a blended oil with soybean in their fryer, which was really unfortunate.\n\nThere’s a lot of potential here—fresh fish, inventive ideas, a casual setup that’s very LA. But execution matters, and for us, it just didn’t deliver.\n\nIn the end, the best things I had were my Diet Coke, the rice and beans, and a taco I couldn’t even eat.

It felt like we were tasting variations of the same dish, which got a little boring. The blood clams were a hard pass for me--they tasted like mole and just didn't sit well. The erizo was underwhelming; I was hoping for something more exciting.\n\nOne odd thing was the accompanying packets of crackers they gave with nearly all the dishes—they just didn’t work well at all. I think these dishes are much better with tortilla chips instead. On the plus side, the food comes out quickly, and the line can get long, but it moves fairly fast. Just a heads-up that the service is kind of non-existent; it's pretty much self-serve. You have to get your own water, hot sauce, and napkins. When we asked one of the food runners for more napkins, she said yes but never came back.\n\nThe freshness of the seafood here is undeniable, but I wouldn't recommend going out of the way to try this place.

My wife and I decided to do a huge sampling of whatever caught our eye on the menu.\n\nThe Spot Prawn and Scallop Aguachile was super fresh (prawns grabbed right out of the tank) and refreshing. The lime cilantro chile sauce was crisp and tasty with a hint of heat. Great summer dish.\n\nBeing a huge ceviche fan we had the Ceviche de Atun. The bluefin tuna was superb. Another well balanced crisp dish that you couldn’t stop eating.\n\nThe star of our meal though was the Tostada de Kanpachi & Uni. An absolute masterpiece. Beautifully layered textures and tastes. The uni was like icing on the cake to some amazing flavors. Even the tostada had amazing flavor. Would come back just for this dish!\n\nThe Pulpo a las Brasas was a pick of mine as I am a sucker for octopus. Super tender with a light char and smokiness. Not sure what the sauce was underneath but it was velvety smokey deliciousness. Even the side of cilantro rice and beans were top notch.\n\nTacos: We had the Baja Fish Taco and the Smoked Kanpachi Taco. Best fish taco I have ever had in my life. Fish was crisp and not greasy. Perfect amount of crema and salsa. The Kanpachi taco was delicious as well but the Baja taco was just a masterpiece of a taco staple. One thing that got my attention in both was the blue corn tortillas. This is what a tortilla is supposed to be. Never had such delicious tortillas in my life. Crazy how the smallest part of the dish can hold up everything and compete in flavor with the exotic ingredients.\n\nAlso enjoyed: we had the sparkling lemonade (tasted more like orange to me). Whatever was in it was amazing and refreshing. Not too sweet.\n\nPricing: who cares. I thought for the level of execution and the quality of ingredients the dishes would be a value at even a higher price point. Great value in my eyes.\n\nUnpretentious culinary adventure in a food hall. Keep doing what you are doing! You have an amazing team kicking out some amazing food!

This honestly has to be top 5-10 best meals I've ever had in my life. Seriously. The seafood is so fresh and melts in your mouth. I had the garlic butter shrimp plate with the grilled bread, cilantro rice, and beans, and the flavor of the shrimp sauce was AMAZING. Since I was hungry, I had an array of different items, including the Tostada with the Kampachi, shrimp, and another fish, and it was out of this world!! The salsas are soooo good! The guacamole was cool (maybe needed a pinch of salt). But the showstopper were the CHURROS. Oh my god!!! Those Churros with the chocolate sauce? INSANE!!! Honestly, I'm going back again before I leave but seriously, this place is beyond words. The prices are reasonable but also range, depending on the dish and it's worth every penny. This place is deserving of its Michellin star and more. Thank you for creating this magical place. Holbox, I love you!!! Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5\n\nFood: 5\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 5"

I've eaten excellent food in Mexico City and this is comparable in quality to the best I tried over there. This restaurant could easily be located in a fancy venue with significantly more expensive prices, so it's to the great fortune of Los Angeles (and tourists like myself) that it isn't.\n\nWe had the kanpachi (smoked fish) and uni tostada, baja fish and pulpo en su tinta (octopus in calamari ink sofrito) tacos, and ceviche (catch of the day — we had tuna). The seafood was all incredibly fresh and delectable. I'm not a fan of octopus but I knew that Holbox makes a good one, and sure enough it had the light flakiness of a delicate fish. There was no \"fishy\" flavour and the sauces were thoughtful and complemented the meat well (I particularly enjoyed the ink sauce that accompanied the octopus taco).\n\nThe table also has five different hot sauces, which are fun to eat with the chips and salsa served before the meal.\n\nWe arrived ten minutes before opening and didn't need to wait in line. There was consistently a line the entire time we were there, but it seemed to be moving quickly.\n\nOne last thing: shout out to the Oaxacan place across the aisle in the food court that makes an awesome cafe de olla!

The octopus and shrimp tacos were an excellent choice: a good portion, fresh ingredients, and well presented.\n\nThe lemonade with soda was refreshing, although a little sweet for my taste.\n\nThe service was friendly and fast, and the atmosphere is relaxed, ideal for enjoying seafood with friends or family.\n\nOverall, a recommended experience if you like seafood with a twist.

It was only about 28 miles, but I spent almost two hours to arrive at Holbox. I don't know why the traffic was so horrible that day, or maybe it was just as normal as every day.\n\nFor friends who know me, I don't go to fine dining frequently. I had too much fine dining back in Shanghai. I'd rather find interesting dining spots--inside food courts, at food trucks, etc. Holbox is a Michelin one-star restaurant, but not pricey. Even though it's in a food court and not a traditional restaurant, it's interesting. The food booth doesn't have its own tables in the food court; they're shared with others.\n\nIt's a Mexican food booth. The boss lady--puebla in Spanish--was tough, but not rude. As with most Michelin spots, there was a queue, but it wasn't too long. I grabbed a table stand and found us a place to sit.\n\nNot long after, the food was served. The free tortilla chips had no shining points--just as normal as in every Mexican restaurant. Crispy, flat dipping, better than nothing. Good for snacking after a long drive.\n\nThe food was served one by one, or you could say delivered one by one:\n\nErizo 5/5\nThe word erizo in Spanish means hedgehog, but it can also mean sea urchin. They actually look quite similar. Basically, it's sea urchin. Not everyone likes it--some love it, some hate it. I'm a big fan, uni in Japanese. There were two sea urchins, each with about four or five roes. Underneath were fish and scallop ceviches, but different from normal ceviche--it was lighter, without vinegar or lemon taste, more pure raw seafood. I liked it. Not cheap at $27 for an appetizer.\n\nTaco de Pulpo en su Tinta (Octopus Taco) 5/5\nBasically, it's an octopus taco, mixed with squid ink or cuttlefish in--I couldn't tell. The ink mostly gave it color, with just a faint hint of the sea for flavor. Each taco had a giant octopus tentacle--three tacos on a plate, one tentacle for each. The texture was excellen--soft, tender, not juicy but still moist, not fishy at all. I bet the octopus was stewed for a long time, which made it so tasty. Very good. $7 for three, which I wouldn't call expensive--actually well priced.\n\nPescado a las Brasas 5/5\nFish, who doesn't like fish? A few-bone fish, no tiny bones. The seabass had only one big bone but no tiny bones between the muscles. It was grilled seabass, not heavily marinated but well seasoned. The freshness was its biggest strength.\n\nCilantro Rice and Black Beans 5/5\nThe rice was served with the grilled seabass, dipped in stewed black beans. I had never tried that before, but it was tasty. Not too much cilantro aroma, but still good. The rice itself was perfectly cooked--grains separated, not sticky. Paired with the black beans, it was a great match.\n\nI recommend this food booth in the food court, not only because of its Michelin crown, but also for the way they used squid/cuttlefish ink, how they treated cilantro, lemon, and avocado. They truly put heart into making good food.

The octopus in the ceviche was tender unlike other places that are rubbery and hard to chew, nor was it fishy, so you know it's fresh.\n\nThe kanpachi taco was a bit too salty.\n\nThe green rice that came with the filete al carbon was surprisingly tasty and actually one of our favorite parts.\n\nThe salsas are extremely spicy (rare and appreciated) and best to use as a few droplets rather than lather over the tacos.\n\nAs for the experience, we had read that the lines would be long and went with flexible expectations and acknowledged that it was a possibility we may arrive and not have a chance to try it. Arrived around 11:30 AM on a Thursday and the line was out the door. The parking lot and street parking were full and people there said it would be about an hour wait so we got a printed menu to go (since it changes every day). We did not feel comfortable leaving our cars so far away from view so we stayed inside it, reviewed the menu, called to order, and waited 45 minutes for the food. When we returned to pick up the food, we managed to get a parking spot as a person left. We chose parking for one hour for around $2.75 since 2 hours was around $8. Since it's a food court, we were able to eat our \"to-go\" food anywhere except at the Holbox bar.\n\nThis was our first Michelin star experience and probably one of the most affordable options out there, so we'll definitely recommend it for budget-conscious people looking for exceptionally fresh and quality ingredients. However, the flavor itself was pretty mild and parking is extremely limited, so be prepared to pay with your time (maybe get in line first at 10:30 AM before it opens).

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm, friendly service and a cozy atmosphere that perfectly blends casual with chic. The ambiance set the tone for what would be an amazing meal.\n\nNow, let's talk about the food – wow! We tried a variety of tacos, and each one was better than the last. The fish taco was incredibly fresh, with a perfect balance of flavors. The shrimp taco was cooked to perfection, plump and juicy, with just the right amount of seasoning. But the real standout for me was the octopus taco – tender and smoky, it had an incredible depth of flavor that really impressed us.\n\nWe also had the uni – it was beyond amazing. Fresh, creamy, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, it was a true treat for seafood lovers. Each bite was a reminder of just how high the quality of ingredients is at Holbox.\n\nThe tacos alone are worth a visit, but we also couldn’t resist the cocktails, which were perfectly crafted and paired so well with the meal. The staff was attentive but never overbearing, and we felt like they genuinely cared about our experience.\n\nOverall, Holbox is one of those spots where you know you’re going to get high-quality food and service every time. I’ll definitely be coming back to try more of their delicious dishes – it’s worth every penny!

I can’t speak too much on the service as they really only bring your food to you and bus your table after you’ve finished. Now the reason why we’re really here is for the food, I would highly recommend the scallop ceviche. It is by far the best dish I have tried. The pulpo taco comes in second for me. Both of these dishes are a must. I’ve tried a few other dishes, but nothing really worth noting, however I still have a list of things I’d like to try.

I will start with the food, but I have a lot to say about the experience.\n\nYou can upload the menu on your phone or get someone in your group to grab a menu. It is good to use your wait time in the long line to the ordering counter wisely. Send others to grab drinks from another vendor. Buy a few tacos from another vendor if you are hungry.\n\nWe tried a lot of dishes. The Baja shrimp taco is traditional, but the shrimp are huge and moist, and the crema and toppings are great. Also quite good was the tostado de jurel. It is yellowtail ceviche, avocado, and an almond salsa on a very crispy corn tortilla base. It was fresh, sour, savory, and yummy. I found the scallop aguachile to be a bit too lime forward, which tends to drown out the sweetness of scallops, but if you eat it with the pieces of avocado and chips, it mellows everything out. Needless to say, all the seafood is bright and fresh.\n\nMy companions really loved the smoked kanpachi tacos, all hot and cheesy, and spicy. The camarones al mojo were sensational. This is a main dish platter, so comes with excellent black beans and cilantro rice, plus toasted bread for sopping up the marinade. The shrimp were HUGE and perfectly prepared. So all in all, the food is terrific.\n\nSo the downsides: You will pretty much have a 30 to 45 minute wait before you can order. You will need to hunt out a table in the loud, noisy, and not very clean dining hall. The food comes out in no particular order. This makes the actual dining rather chaotic. Our 6 items cost over $100. Michelin star or not, to me, how I am served and the atmosphere in which I eat makes a difference. Is the food great? Yes. Does eating it amid the chaos make it less nice? Yes, absolutely.\n\nI have eaten at a lot of Michelin started restaurants all over the world. Does this rate a Michelin star? I don't think so. But I do recommend eating here.

Octopus was tasty moist and soft, the seabass was perfectly grilled that you can lift the fillet off the bone in one piece.  The corn tortillas were soft and fresh.  Nice. Not cheap but well worth it.\nThe place actually is a food court with other food stalls so don’t go to the wrong counter, seating is shared and don’t expect table cloths or linen.\nWent there again for lunch before the basketball game . Highly recommend smoked kanpachi and scallop tacos.  Pulpo is good too.\nAgain, this place is a food court so don’t expect romantic lightings and table cloths.

I also got to try the Baja Shrimp Taco which offered very different flavors, but made you feel like you were eating seaside.

This was the best food I’ve had in LA so far — we ordered fairly reasonably priced items and felt incredibly satisfied leaving. I was able to have perfectly crunchy and soft bites of the Baja Fish Taco, which tasted even more delicious topped with the extra hot sauces that are provided by the counter. I also got to try the Baja Shrimp Taco which offered very different flavors, but made you feel like you were eating seaside. The Filete al Carbon was another good one — plenty of beans and rice and avo with a healthy filet of branzino. Would recommend splitting a few different dishes if you’re going with someone else! The market was bustling but we found seating easily and it was enjoyable to be around other people that were loving the taste of their food, too. Seems like a great place for lunch, a casual date, or just a fun outing with kids!

This is one of those rare places where the hype is not just met but exceeded in every possible way.\n\nSo, to all my fellow food lovers, hear me now: Being a foodie may be a euphemism for being a little greedy, but at Holbox, it’s an indulgence that will feed your soul.

The vibe is relaxed, yet the food is out of this world.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of tacos to try: Smoked Kanpachi Taco - wow, the smoky flavor was just right. Then there was the Taco de Pulpo en su Tinta, which was an explosion of rich, tangy ink sauce paired with perfectly cooked octopus. The Taco de Pescado al Carbon had that amazing char-grilled flavor, and the Scallop Taco - so tender and fresh, I honestly wanted another round of those. The Baja Fish Taco didn’t disappoint either; crispy and flavorful, just how it should be.\n\nFor sharing, we got the Pulpo A Las Brasas and Coctel Mixto. The grilled octopus (Pulpo A Las Brasas) was a standout - tender, with a crispy exterior and packed with flavor. The Coctel Mixto was a delightful, refreshing mix of seafood that balanced out the richer dishes perfectly.\n\nOverall, Holbox delivered an incredible dining experience with every single dish. It’s definitely a must-visit for anyone looking to explore high-end Mexican fusion food. Can't wait to go back and try more!

Nestled within Mercado la Paloma, a historic landmark brimming with culture and a variety of unique food offerings, this restaurant provides a unique and memorable dining experience.\n\nI began my meal with the Taco de pulpo en su tinta, a delightful dish featuring braised and fried Gulf of Mexico octopus. The octopus was tender and perfectly cooked, enhanced by the rich, savory calamari ink sofrito. The depth of flavor in this dish was outstanding, with each bite revealing a nuanced blend of textures and tastes that truly highlighted the quality of the ingredients.\n\nNext, I indulged in the Scallop taco, a masterpiece of pan-seared Maine diver scallops. The scallops were succulent and cooked to perfection, accompanied by a vibrant salsa \"x'catic\" that added a touch of heat. The caramelized onions, tomato, and marinated fennel provided a sweet and tangy contrast, elevating the overall flavor profile of the dish. The combination of these elements created a harmonious and sophisticated taste that lingered pleasantly on the palate.\n\nThe Cóctel mixto was another highlight, featuring a mix of wild Mexican shrimp, Gulf of Mexico octopus, and Baja bay scallop. The seafood was fresh and succulent, and the house-made sweet and sour cocktail sauce added a refreshing and zesty touch. The balance of sweetness and acidity in the sauce complemented the natural flavors of the seafood beautifully, making this dish a refreshing and satisfying option.\n\nThe ambiance at Holbox is charming and laid-back, set within the vibrant environment of Mercado la Paloma. The market itself is a treasure trove of cultural experiences, offering a diverse array of food choices. It's a great place to explore and soak in the rich cultural tapestry of Los Angeles.\n\nHolbox's approach to customer service is unique, with a casual system where food and drinks are dropped off at your table, rather than traditional waiter service. This setup adds to the relaxed atmosphere, allowing diners to enjoy their meal at their own pace without the formality of a traditional restaurant.\n\nOverall, my experience at Holbox was delightful.

Instead of checking with the customer who seated there waiting for that long, they chose to just let the food getting cold…The taste of the food was not bad but definitely not special. The service and the environment don’t deserve a Michelin star. I understand that when your restaurant gets a star, it will become very popular, but it doesn’t mean that you have to sacrifice the guest experience and customer service. I guess they will only concern about you when you order the tasting menu that is over $100 per person…I would rather go to Guerrilla Taco in downtown LA, at least you receive good service, sit at proper environment and get food with reasonable pricing.

The scallops taco was cooked to perfection like I’ve never tasted scallops this well cooked before! Finally, it was my first time to try sea urchins, and they were absolutely delicious!

We got there about 15 minutes before opening, so parking was easy and we were part of the first group in line.\n\nHolbox serves Yucatán-style seafood tacos, and every single one we tried was incredible. We ordered the scallop taco, octopus taco, smoked kanpachi taco, Baja fish taco, and the aguachile with spot prawn and scallops. The scallop was buttery and sweet, the octopus was super tender with that perfect char, and the smoked kanpachi had this deep, smoky flavor that was just insane. The aguachile was bright, spicy, and refreshing—perfect for a warm day.\n\nThe service was exceptional. You order at the counter, and they somehow manage to bring everything out quickly and perfectly timed, even with so many tables scattered around the market. It’s impressive how smoothly everything runs.\n\nWe finished with the churros and chocolate sauce, which were the perfect ending—crispy, light, and the chocolate was rich but not overly sweet.\n\nThe small lot is paid (about $4 an hour), but there’s some free street parking if you get lucky. Definitely worth coming a little early for a spot.\n\nCan’t wait to come back and try more of the menu, especially anything with uni. This place is a gem.

For being Michelin starred, I think one comment is that the two ceviches we got had the same type of flavor. I couldn't really tell the flavors apart between fishes because it was covered by the same ceviche flavor profile. It was delicious nonetheless, but I wonder if other fish dishes on the menu are the same...as I said, I still think about the pulpo. Perfect char, accompanied by the perfect sauce.

The staff is very helpful and attentive. We spoke with one of the owners Briana and you can tell she has a true passion for what she does.\nWe went here three nights in a row, not for lack of restaurant options as there are plenty to choose from in Los Angeles, but because it was just an amazing experience all around.\nWe tried the scallop Agua Chile, several of the tostadas, all the tacos, the grilled kanpachi collars, coctel de camarones, the scallop and Uni ceviche, and several other dishes. Every single, one of them deserves perfect reviews. Their freshly made blue corn tortillas alone are worth the trip.\nPrices are very modest and won’t break the bank for the quality of food and service that you receive.

I started off with a sparkling lemonade and a taco de pulpo en su tinta. The taco was very good. The octopus was tender and went well with the calamari ink sofrito. Next I got a tostada de atun. Bluefin tuna, avocado puree and arbol peanut sauce. The combination of all 3 were great! And the homemade tostada was easy to eat. Didn't crumble at any bites, so you're enjoying every component of the plate. Lastly, I got an entrée of pulpo a la brasa. The smokiness of the octopus combined with the almond pipian was spot-on! Combine that to make a taco with the baby tomatoes and avocado slices it was a perfect combo!\n\nOverall, a great experience at $57.00.

The food was absolutely delightful—each dish was succulent and bursting with flavor, leaving me craving more.\n\nWhile we started with the classic guacamole, we also tried the Baja and shrimp tacos simply because the line moved so fast we didn't get a chance to review the menu. Holbox operates like a well-oiled machine, ensuring fast and attentive service that perfectly complements the delightful food. I was particularly impressed with the portions of the seafood soup, and the smoked kampachi tostado was a treat for anyone who enjoys that rich, smoky flavor. However, the true stars of the meal were the bluefin ceviche and the kampachi and uni tostado. They were so exquisite that, despite being full, I simply couldn’t help but savor every last bite. A big thank you to Gilberto for recommending the ceviche—it was a highlight of my culinary adventure!\n\nAs I left, I found myself already planning a return trip to try the abalone, lobster, and octopus. A girl can only eat but so much in one sitting. 😆\n\nGilberto, I look forward to seeing you in my city soon at Zahav!

Nestled within Mercado la Paloma, a historic landmark brimming with culture and a variety of unique food offerings, this restaurant provides a unique and memorable dining experience.\n\nI began my meal with the Taco de pulpo en su tinta, a delightful dish featuring braised and fried Gulf of Mexico octopus. The octopus was tender and perfectly cooked, enhanced by the rich, savory calamari ink sofrito. The depth of flavor in this dish was outstanding, with each bite revealing a nuanced blend of textures and tastes that truly highlighted the quality of the ingredients.\n\nNext, I indulged in the Scallop taco, a masterpiece of pan-seared Maine diver scallops. The scallops were succulent and cooked to perfection, accompanied by a vibrant salsa \"x'catic\" that added a touch of heat. The caramelized onions, tomato, and marinated fennel provided a sweet and tangy contrast, elevating the overall flavor profile of the dish. The combination of these elements created a harmonious and sophisticated taste that lingered pleasantly on the palate.\n\nThe Cóctel mixto was another highlight, featuring a mix of wild Mexican shrimp, Gulf of Mexico octopus, and Baja bay scallop. The seafood was fresh and succulent, and the house-made sweet and sour cocktail sauce added a refreshing and zesty touch. The balance of sweetness and acidity in the sauce complemented the natural flavors of the seafood beautifully, making this dish a refreshing and satisfying option.\n\nThe ambiance at Holbox is charming and laid-back, set within the vibrant environment of Mercado la Paloma. The market itself is a treasure trove of cultural experiences, offering a diverse array of food choices. It's a great place to explore and soak in the rich cultural tapestry of Los Angeles.\n\nHolbox's approach to customer service is unique, with a casual system where food and drinks are dropped off at your table, rather than traditional waiter service. This setup adds to the relaxed atmosphere, allowing diners to enjoy their meal at their own pace without the formality of a traditional restaurant.\n\nOverall, my experience at Holbox was delightful. Each dish showcased a thoughtful blend of high-quality ingredients and innovative flavors, making it clear why this establishment has earned a Michelin star. The ambiance and service add to the experience, making it a must-visit for anyone looking to explore the rich culinary landscape of Los Angeles.

When the food came, they’re already cold. Instead of checking with the customer who seated there waiting for that long, they chose to just let the food getting cold…The taste of the food was not bad but definitely not special. The service and the environment don’t deserve a Michelin star. I understand that when your restaurant gets a star, it will become very popular, but it doesn’t mean that you have to sacrifice the guest experience and customer service. I guess they will only concern about you when you order the tasting menu that is over $100 per person…I would rather go to Guerrilla Taco in downtown LA, at least you receive good service, sit at proper environment and get food with reasonable pricing.

We ordered the scallop taco, octopus taco, smoked kanpachi taco, Baja fish taco, and the aguachile with spot prawn and scallops. The scallop was buttery and sweet, the octopus was super tender with that perfect char, and the smoked kanpachi had this deep, smoky flavor that was just insane. The aguachile was bright, spicy, and refreshing—perfect for a warm day.\n\nThe service was exceptional. You order at the counter, and they somehow manage to bring everything out quickly and perfectly timed, even with so many tables scattered around the market. It’s impressive how smoothly everything runs.\n\nWe finished with the churros and chocolate sauce, which were the perfect ending—crispy, light, and the chocolate was rich but not overly sweet.\n\nThe small lot is paid (about $4 an hour), but there’s some free street parking if you get lucky. Definitely worth coming a little early for a spot.\n\nCan’t wait to come back and try more of the menu, especially anything with uni. This place is a gem.

It was only about 28 miles, but I spent almost two hours to arrive at Holbox. I don't know why the traffic was so horrible that day, or maybe it was just as normal as every day.\n\nFor friends who know me, I don't go to fine dining frequently. I had too much fine dining back in Shanghai. I'd rather find interesting dining spots--inside food courts, at food trucks, etc. Holbox is a Michelin one-star restaurant, but not pricey. Even though it's in a food court and not a traditional restaurant, it's interesting. The food booth doesn't have its own tables in the food court; they're shared with others.\n\nIt's a Mexican food booth. The boss lady--puebla in Spanish--was tough, but not rude. As with most Michelin spots, there was a queue, but it wasn't too long. I grabbed a table stand and found us a place to sit.\n\nNot long after, the food was served. The free tortilla chips had no shining points--just as normal as in every Mexican restaurant. Crispy, flat dipping, better than nothing. Good for snacking after a long drive.\n\nThe food was served one by one, or you could say delivered one by one:\n\nErizo 5/5\nThe word erizo in Spanish means hedgehog, but it can also mean sea urchin. They actually look quite similar. Basically, it's sea urchin. Not everyone likes it--some love it, some hate it. I'm a big fan, uni in Japanese. There were two sea urchins, each with about four or five roes. Underneath were fish and scallop ceviches, but different from normal ceviche--it was lighter, without vinegar or lemon taste, more pure raw seafood. I liked it. Not cheap at $27 for an appetizer.\n\nTaco de Pulpo en su Tinta (Octopus Taco) 5/5\nBasically, it's an octopus taco, mixed with squid ink or cuttlefish in--I couldn't tell. The ink mostly gave it color, with just a faint hint of the sea for flavor. Each taco had a giant octopus tentacle--three tacos on a plate, one tentacle for each. The texture was excellen--soft, tender, not juicy but still moist, not fishy at all. I bet the octopus was stewed for a long time, which made it so tasty. Very good. $7 for three, which I wouldn't call expensive--actually well priced.\n\nPescado a las Brasas 5/5\nFish, who doesn't like fish? A few-bone fish, no tiny bones. The seabass had only one big bone but no tiny bones between the muscles. It was grilled seabass, not heavily marinated but well seasoned. The freshness was its biggest strength.\n\nCilantro Rice and Black Beans 5/5\nThe rice was served with the grilled seabass, dipped in stewed black beans. I had never tried that before, but it was tasty. Not too much cilantro aroma, but still good. The rice itself was perfectly cooked--grains separated, not sticky. Paired with the black beans, it was a great match.\n\nI recommend this food booth in the food court, not only because of its Michelin crown, but also for the way they used squid/cuttlefish ink, how they treated cilantro, lemon, and avocado. They truly put heart into making good food.

The parking lot and street parking were full and people there said it would be about an hour wait so we got a printed menu to go (since it changes every day). We did not feel comfortable leaving our cars so far away from view so we stayed inside it, reviewed the menu, called to order, and waited 45 minutes for the food. When we returned to pick up the food, we managed to get a parking spot as a person left. We chose parking for one hour for around $2.75 since 2 hours was around $8. Since it's a food court, we were able to eat our \"to-go\" food anywhere except at the Holbox bar.\n\nThis was our first Michelin star experience and probably one of the most affordable options out there, so we'll definitely recommend it for budget-conscious people looking for exceptionally fresh and quality ingredients. However, the flavor itself was pretty mild and parking is extremely limited, so be prepared to pay with your time (maybe get in line first at 10:30 AM before it opens).

The standouts were the tostada, uni, smoked Kanpachi taco, and the grilled lobster. The Uni was fresh and buttery, served in its shell with scallop and an aioli-like sauce of somekind, mouthwatering. Lobster was grilled evenly, pre broken, served with melted butter, avocado tomatoes, and what can go wrong with a live lobster? Nothing, and they weighed the lobster in front of us, let us snap photos despite being so busy which was sweet of them. The smoked kanpachi taco was great with tender fish and a crunchy blue corn shell. The only dishes we wouldn’t order again were the blood clams, and octopus taco. The taco was chewy and the clams just didn't stand out among the rest.\n\nThe food came out as it was ready, so pacing wasn’t ideal, but understandable for this kind of spot.\n\nAll in all, Holbox is absolutely worth a visit.

The lime cilantro chile sauce was crisp and tasty with a hint of heat. Great summer dish.\n\nBeing a huge ceviche fan we had the Ceviche de Atun. The bluefin tuna was superb. Another well balanced crisp dish that you couldn’t stop eating.\n\nThe star of our meal though was the Tostada de Kanpachi & Uni. An absolute masterpiece. Beautifully layered textures and tastes. The uni was like icing on the cake to some amazing flavors. Even the tostada had amazing flavor. Would come back just for this dish!\n\nThe Pulpo a las Brasas was a pick of mine as I am a sucker for octopus. Super tender with a light char and smokiness. Not sure what the sauce was underneath but it was velvety smokey deliciousness. Even the side of cilantro rice and beans were top notch.\n\nTacos: We had the Baja Fish Taco and the Smoked Kanpachi Taco. Best fish taco I have ever had in my life. Fish was crisp and not greasy. Perfect amount of crema and salsa. The Kanpachi taco was delicious as well but the Baja taco was just a masterpiece of a taco staple. One thing that got my attention in both was the blue corn tortillas. This is what a tortilla is supposed to be. Never had such delicious tortillas in my life. Crazy how the smallest part of the dish can hold up everything and compete in flavor with the exotic ingredients.\n\nAlso enjoyed: we had the sparkling lemonade (tasted more like orange to me). Whatever was in it was amazing and refreshing. Not too sweet.\n\nPricing: who cares. I thought for the level of execution and the quality of ingredients the dishes would be a value at even a higher price point. Great value in my eyes.\n\nUnpretentious culinary adventure in a food hall. Keep doing what you are doing! You have an amazing team kicking out some amazing food!

The fish taco was incredibly fresh, with a perfect balance of flavors. The shrimp taco was cooked to perfection, plump and juicy, with just the right amount of seasoning. But the real standout for me was the octopus taco – tender and smoky, it had an incredible depth of flavor that really impressed us.\n\nWe also had the uni – it was beyond amazing. Fresh, creamy, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, it was a true treat for seafood lovers. Each bite was a reminder of just how high the quality of ingredients is at Holbox.\n\nThe tacos alone are worth a visit, but we also couldn’t resist the cocktails, which were perfectly crafted and paired so well with the meal. The staff was attentive but never overbearing, and we felt like they genuinely cared about our experience.\n\nOverall, Holbox is one of those spots where you know you’re going to get high-quality food and service every time.

Raw scallops were sweet and briny, perfectly balanced by a zesty green chile-lime sauce, and beautifully presented with red onions and an avocado rose.\n\nI then sampled a trio of tacos:\n\nThe Octopus Taco was unlike any I’ve had—tender grilled octopus served on a deep, savory squid ink sofrito with bright bursts of tomato and chive.\n\nThe Scallop Taco featured a seared scallop, lightly caramelized on the outside, paired with a peppery sauce and shredded lettuce for freshness.\n\nThe Smoked Kampachi Taco came in a crisp shell, delivering a subtle smokiness to the cooked yellowtail—unique and absolutely delicious.\n\nEvery dish reflects a careful blend of traditional Baja flavors with modern technique and elegance. Holbox is a must-visit for anyone who loves Mexican seafood done right—and elevated to fine-dining standards.

I will start with the food, but I have a lot to say about the experience.\n\nYou can upload the menu on your phone or get someone in your group to grab a menu. It is good to use your wait time in the long line to the ordering counter wisely. Send others to grab drinks from another vendor. Buy a few tacos from another vendor if you are hungry.\n\nWe tried a lot of dishes. The Baja shrimp taco is traditional, but the shrimp are huge and moist, and the crema and toppings are great. Also quite good was the tostado de jurel. It is yellowtail ceviche, avocado, and an almond salsa on a very crispy corn tortilla base. It was fresh, sour, savory, and yummy. I found the scallop aguachile to be a bit too lime forward, which tends to drown out the sweetness of scallops, but if you eat it with the pieces of avocado and chips, it mellows everything out. Needless to say, all the seafood is bright and fresh.\n\nMy companions really loved the smoked kanpachi tacos, all hot and cheesy, and spicy. The camarones al mojo were sensational. This is a main dish platter, so comes with excellent black beans and cilantro rice, plus toasted bread for sopping up the marinade. The shrimp were HUGE and perfectly prepared. So all in all, the food is terrific.\n\nSo the downsides: You will pretty much have a 30 to 45 minute wait before you can order. You will need to hunt out a table in the loud, noisy, and not very clean dining hall. The food comes out in no particular order. This makes the actual dining rather chaotic. Our 6 items cost over $100. Michelin star or not, to me, how I am served and the atmosphere in which I eat makes a difference. Is the food great? Yes. Does eating it amid the chaos make it less nice? Yes, absolutely.\n\nI have eaten at a lot of Michelin started restaurants all over the world. Does this rate a Michelin star? I don't think so. But I do recommend eating here.

There was a line stretching to the door, but it moved fairly quickly. After ordering, we grabbed a number and found a seat by the door. Unfortunately, things took a turn when the line was moved inside, right next to our table. It was loud and awkward to eat with people standing so close, so we had to relocate mid-meal. Thankfully, shortly after we moved, they relocated the line back outside to address the same concerns other diners had.\n\nAs for the food, we started with the sparkling lemonade, which was wonderfully bubbly with a perfectly balanced sweet and acidic flavor. It tasted freshly squeezed with no artificial coloring, giving it a very homemade feel.\n\nNext, we received complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were freshly fried and crunchy, but the salsa was a bit too acidic for my taste.\n\nWe ordered the uni and kanpachi tostada, which had simple yet effective flavors of salt, pepper, and lime juice that allowed the freshness of the fish and uni to really shine.\n\nThe ceviche mixto had a similar flavor profile—salt, pepper, lime juice, finely chopped onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and a mix of fresh fish, shrimp, and octopus. While the seafood was undeniably fresh, I found it too salty and lacking in umami. A touch of sweetness and more depth would have made it more enjoyable. The tostada that accompanied the ceviche was light, airy, and perfectly crunchy—not your typical tostada, which was a nice surprise.\n\nFor the tacos, the scallop tacos were absolutely delicious. The scallops were tender, and the pickled onions and grilled cherry tomatoes added just the right amount of acidity to balance the dish. The octopus tacos were the highlight. Perfectly cooked octopus paired with calamari ink sofrito created an unforgettable dish—one of the best octopus taco I’ve ever had. They did forget to remove the bay leaf from the sofrito, though I’m not sure if that was intentional.\n\nWe also tried the Taco de Pescado al Carbon, featuring mesquite grilled Baja California kanpachi, mayo, morita sauce, cabbage, pico de gallo, and avocado puree. The fish was tender, but the skin was a little too chewy for my taste—I would have preferred it to be crunchier.\n\nThe shrimp tacos, while decent, didn’t particularly stand out. They featured battered fried shrimp, garnish, and mayo, which was good but nothing extraordinary.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience trying unique dishes, and I’d definitely return. Next time, I’ll stick to the hot tacos and skip the ceviche unless they add more umami. Food: 4 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 3\n\nFood: 4\nService: 4\nAtmosphere: 3"

Nestled within the vibrant Mercado La Paloma, this unassuming gem has redefined my understanding of what it means to truly live. I came here for a simple business meeting, but little did I know, I was about to embark on a gastronomic journey so profound that it would forever change the way I perceive the humble taco.\n\nLet me start with the fish tacos—oh, the fish tacos! These aren’t just tacos, my friends; these are divine creations, descended from the heavens, kissed by the sea, and delivered to your plate with the grace of a thousand angels. The fish, perfectly crisp on the outside, yet tender and succulent within, was embraced by a tortilla so divine it could be the fabric of the gods themselves. And that ceviche? A burst of oceanic bliss that sent my taste buds into an ecstatic frenzy, dancing and singing praises to the culinary gods!\n\nI found myself utterly mesmerized, unable to focus on the matters of business at hand. My associate, equally ensnared by the spell of Holbox, could only nod in agreement as we devoured these masterpieces in a shared state of euphoria.\n\nBut, alas, the path to paradise is not without its trials. The parking situation? A labyrinthine ordeal, forcing me to traverse nearly 300 meters from my vehicle to the gates of this culinary Eden. The prices? Not for the faint of heart, but let me assure you, every single penny was worth the price of admission to this nirvana of flavor.\n\nAnd yes, the wait—oh, the wait—was long and torturous. Yet, like a true pilgrimage, the reward at the end was nothing short of transcendent. This is one of those rare places where the hype is not just met but exceeded in every possible way.\n\nSo, to all my fellow food lovers, hear me now: Being a foodie may be a euphemism for being a little greedy, but at Holbox, it’s an indulgence that will feed your soul. Go forth, and eat those tacos, my friends. Eat those tacos!\n\nLocation: 3655 S Grand Ave, Ste C9, Los Angeles, CA 90007\nWebsite: Holbox Los Angeles\n\nEnjoy!

This restaurant could easily be located in a fancy venue with significantly more expensive prices, so it's to the great fortune of Los Angeles (and tourists like myself) that it isn't.\n\nWe had the kanpachi (smoked fish) and uni tostada, baja fish and pulpo en su tinta (octopus in calamari ink sofrito) tacos, and ceviche (catch of the day — we had tuna). The seafood was all incredibly fresh and delectable. I'm not a fan of octopus but I knew that Holbox makes a good one, and sure enough it had the light flakiness of a delicate fish. There was no \"fishy\" flavour and the sauces were thoughtful and complemented the meat well (I particularly enjoyed the ink sauce that accompanied the octopus taco).\n\nThe table also has five different hot sauces, which are fun to eat with the chips and salsa served before the meal.\n\nWe arrived ten minutes before opening and didn't need to wait in line. There was consistently a line the entire time we were there, but it seemed to be moving quickly.\n\nOne last thing: shout out to the Oaxacan place across the aisle in the food court that makes an awesome cafe de olla!

Here is my review by item:\n\nHalibut tostada - 10/10 - Spectacular, by far the best halibut ceviche I have had to date. The fish is premium quality and melt-in your mouth and the exact right amount of citrus to spice.\n\nAtun Tostada (Tuna Ceviche) - 7/10 - Good. The fish is very fresh but the flavor profile of the ceviche mix can use some work. Also, I am a seafood lover and the white-ish sauce paired with the tuna looked unappealing at first presentation, even to me.\n\nTaco de Pulpo en su Tinta (Braised Octopus taco)  - 0/10 - Disgusting!!!! So gross the lingering flavor was making me nauseous on the ride home. (Note: Ive eaten octopus many times - I tried this based on many good experiences). You get a big tortilla with just a piece of crisped (bland) octopus that tasted old and had an extremely gamey flavor. I hated this. Regret ordering it.\n\nScallop Taco - 1/10 - A throwaway dish undeserving of the good money paid for it. Turns out Scallops don’t belong in tacos. Being such a novelty I just had to try it. Huge mistake. Again, the tortilla to filling ratio was way off. All I could taste was bread. The scallops were extremely bland, had a boiled texture - no sear, no char. With only 2 scallops in a thick tortilla, it was like they weren’t even there. Such a waste of perfectly good scallops. Hated this.\n\nAll 3 stars are for the ceviches (tostadas). The cooked seafood is so awful I am insulted I was charged money for them as I feel I should be paid for the trouble of eating them.

It felt like we were tasting variations of the same dish, which got a little boring. The blood clams were a hard pass for me--they tasted like mole and just didn't sit well. The erizo was underwhelming; I was hoping for something more exciting.\n\nOne odd thing was the accompanying packets of crackers they gave with nearly all the dishes—they just didn’t work well at all. I think these dishes are much better with tortilla chips instead. On the plus side, the food comes out quickly, and the line can get long, but it moves fairly fast. Just a heads-up that the service is kind of non-existent; it's pretty much self-serve. You have to get your own water, hot sauce, and napkins. When we asked one of the food runners for more napkins, she said yes but never came back.\n\nThe freshness of the seafood here is undeniable, but I wouldn't recommend going out of the way to try this place.
