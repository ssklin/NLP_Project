Highly recommend NikuX, especially if you’re lucky enough to have Darren and Byron taking care of you!"

Perfect service (they actually carried in a bench seat for us because the chairs were too narrow) all the food was amazing! But I highly suggest the Chilean Sea Bass wraps! Life changing!!! The sashimi was THE best I've had in SoCal.  We loved that they had warm butter on tap (I would have preferred it to not be garlic butter) The steaks absolutely ruined me for all future steaks! Melt in your mouth doesn't do it justice.  I expected to focus on the lobster tail but to be honest, I was a little disappointed in them. I tried 3 different tails and none of them were easy to remove from the shell even though they were all cut down the back. The flavor was good however and they were nice sized. The star of the night was by far the Chilean Sea Bass!!! Do not skip it! We paid $119 each plus $16 for valet parking (loved that option) and we considered it completely worth every penny.

We got seated right away with reservations for a friend's birthday and service was extraordinary.There's two weekend dinner options: regular $119/$109 for Chubby plus members)or $159/$149(members).\n\nBuffet: fruits, seaweed and octopus salad, ceviche, raw veggies to grill, regular salad and sauces.\nSushi: crudo of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, tartare and unagi don.\nMeat display: brisket and chef's choice.\n\nHot Seafood: King crab and snow crab served hot not cold like other buffets.  They used to have lobster tails accessible, but you now order with your server and it came out hot, precut for easy peeling, and so plump, juicy, and sweet! Also, even though our reservation was at 5:30PM,  they had ran out of hot seafood at 5:45PM. Instead of refilling it, they said they will refill it at 6PM. So expect to come back.  They refilled it around 6PM and everything was cooked perfectly;  not overcooked or dry. Both types of crab legs were sweet, juicy, and slightly salty. Perhaps because it is not the season, the King crab legs were sadly skinny.\nRaw Bar: scallops, shrimp, prawns and mussels with their respective sauces and sushi rolls.\n\nOrder with Server:\nAppetizers: potato tarrine: flaky layers of deep fried potato.\nOxtail potsticker: juicy and flavorful.\nMiso Chilean seabass on a lettuce cup: our favorite but the miso glaze was a bit too sweet for us.\nWagyu curry: texture of slightly crunchy carrots, tender wagyu beef over rice is just so comforting and hearty.\nThe men really loved shitshito peppers\nOther apps: deep fried broccoli, miso corn, wagyu pepper beef, chicken wings, waffle fries which is basic.\n\nSoups: tom yum is good for those who like the kick of spice and hint of coconut.\nMiso soup: Ironically, it didn't taste like miso soup, it was more like light dashi soup with mushrooms, tofu and seaweed.\nDesserts: egg tarts are a must if you want crispy, flakey, and crunchy layers of crust with just enough egg custard.\nAnother favorite was the mille crepe with chocolate cream, but was informed tonight, it is not offered anymore.\nHazelnut cake: not too sweet and soft.\nOther desserts: earl Grey and vanilla cake roll was okay. They don't make some of the desserts and instead choose to serve those packaged cakes you get from the Asian grocery store. The dessert option doesn’t align with the premium exclusive experience they're aiming for.\n\nMeats: sticking to the basic menu is just as satisfying especially if you enjoy the thinner slices of brisket and beef tongue. If you really want to try the thicker cuts of premium meats, then choose the premium menu. Sadly, our favorite, the aged tomahawk which has to be reserved 24 hours in advance was removed from their menu so it is no longer an option.\nDrinks: yuzu sparkler and peach slush.\nRefreshing and so good after a salty and fatty meal. No comment, I can probably down a gallon of it.\n\nAnd lastly, Joe ,our server, was so friendly and fun. He made wonderful recommendations and was responsive to all of our requests. He made everything so fast and easy by having the bill and parking validation ready before we even had to ask about it. He even threw in special little touches like a grilled lobster tail option that is not on the menu, and made everyone have an amazing dinner experience. Do note, the grilled lobster tail was very salty, so you can ask them to be a little less heavy handed in the seasoning if possible.\n\nOverall, this is a great place to celebrate a special occasion like birthdays or anniversaries for unlimited seafood and specialty meats like A5 wagyu.  They do stritctly enforce the 90 min so I would avoid bringing babies or young children, those who don't eat and or picky eaters if possible as you may spend most of your time catering to them.

No comment, I can probably down a gallon of it.\n\nAnd lastly, Joe ,our server, was so friendly and fun. He made wonderful recommendations and was responsive to all of our requests. He made everything so fast and easy by having the bill and parking validation ready before we even had to ask about it. He even threw in special little touches like a grilled lobster tail option that is not on the menu, and made everyone have an amazing dinner experience. Do note, the grilled lobster tail was very salty, so you can ask them to be a little less heavy handed in the seasoning if possible.\n\nOverall, this is a great place to celebrate a special occasion like birthdays or anniversaries for unlimited seafood and specialty meats like A5 wagyu.  They do stritctly enforce the 90 min so I would avoid bringing babies or young children, those who don't eat and or picky eaters if possible as you may spend most of your time catering to them. If you can't, you have to be really strategic to maximize your time and pocket.

We were never offered dessert, instead got a little slushie cup for my birthday. For the experience, I would recommend if you’re willing to consume seafood and raw sushi, otherwise it’s not worth it just for the wagyu steaks.

The food was incredible, especially the Tomahawk Ritual my wife ordered—it was extremely delicious. What made the evening truly special was being there with Lissette. We had a private table in the back, which added to the atmosphere.\n\nUnfortunately, the buffet was smaller than I expected, and the service was lacking. Our server, James, was friendly and had a great smile, but he was rarely at our table. We often had to ask other staff to find him for us when we needed something. Given the cost of the experience, we expected better service and likely won't be returning. Nonetheless, it was a memorable night thanks to my wife.

Staff kept up with table maintenance, always asking to clear instead of removing dishes in a hurry. We did not feel rushed and felt that the servers did pay proper attention to service rather than the 'flip and dip' service of many area restaurants.

Just be aware to make a reservation you have to put down a deposit, which I did(cost depending on your party size).  There are different types of tables too(a la carte, tasting & others) & I chose the Yakiniku tasting.\n\nFirst off it’s an expensive spot, if you just want to get full on meat, you can go to my favorite spot, Quarters KBBQ in Koreatown. This spot is more of an elaborate presentation & elevated dining experience. The decor and interior overall was solid & I wish I could of toured the whole location.\n\nThe tasting was absolutely phenomenal, but If I had to do it all over again, I think I would have went for the Tomahawk upgrade. I sat in an area without a view, which would have been something I’d recommend in getting to fully enjoy the experience. Also I forgot to get a good glass of red wine to pair with the offerings. The bar area was solid & I wonder if you can just walk in for just the bar area.\n\nEach dish was carefully crafted and made to joyfully amuse your tastebuds. The meats were so fresh, seasoned perfectly & probably the best I’ve ever had, but at a cost. There is so much more to explore on their menu, like their Wagyu bone Marrow, other entrees & desserts.\n\nI’d definitely come back again to try their tomahawk offering.  Once I try their best option & get a better view of the spot, than I can justify a full 5 stars(will take a while because I got to recoup some funds lol).  The customer service though is without a doubt excellent and deserving of a 5 because they cater to a lot of the needs you had as a customer.\n\nJust be aware it’s valet mainly or discounted parking but not free.  I walked to this spot to avoid the parking hoopla. Enjoy the spot & yolo responsibly!\n\n***updated***\nRecently did the Wagyu Tomahawk Tasting and it was phenomenal, just check out the pictures and videos. Originally I rated this spot four stars for their sushi mainly but after this tomahawk experience, it’s now a full 5 stars.\n\n***Update***\nI tried their $150 all you can eat wagyu buffet with seafood and lobster with my parents. It was phenomenal and thanks to Kelly our server for an excellent experience.\n\nMy warning to you is eat to be satisfied and don’t go overboard otherwise they will charge you for wasting food. Luckily my parents and I ate it all but I should have stopped a few plates ago. The Wagyu quality was top notch and the menu items were excellent.\n\nFor the price it’s worth it and I would say pace yourself.

The wagyu was fantastic, the seafood was mostly very delicious, and the sides that you order from the kitchen were all very good as well.

While I really enjoyed 90% of the seafood selection, I will say that the crab and lobster were a bit underwhelming. One of the crabs (can't remember which kind) was very salty, while the lobster had a somewhat rubbery texture. Aside from the seafood, the beef options were all fantastic and melt-in-your-mouth. The cocktails were well-made and delicious, but seemed light on alcohol. We also ordered a couple of soft drinks, which were fairly expensive and not a good value ($6 for a tiny glass bottle of Coke). The service was very good throughout the entire dining experience and I was impressed that the servers came to change our grill often without us asking. The primary reason I am taking off a star from my review is that our server essentially bribed us into giving him a good review on Yelp by offering to comp our soft drinks. I assumed that meant we could write him a good review on our own terms, but instead he took our phones, copied and pasted an AI-generated review on Yelp, and asked us to post it. It was honestly quite uncomfortable and it makes me question how legitimate the other reviews are for this establishment. Just something to be aware of.

I brought back my family and it was a fantastic night. I read and saw some recent reviews on both IG and YT complaining that they were left hungry and servers deliberately withheld food for long periods of time or wouldn't refill the buffet. I absolutely did not see any of that the entire two hours I ate there.\n\nOur server Wilson always made sure to check on us frequently and make sure our orders came out in a timely manner. If there was a little wait on any item, he always came to let us know immediately and asked if we wanted anything else. However we never waited too long for anything and we had a delicious and fantastic meal. Also I never saw the buffet empty like some reviewers said. There always was a refill on food and honestly it was worth every penny to dine here.\n\nThere are so many things available in our $139 buffet that honestly 1 trip and even 2 trips is not enough to try out the entire menu. There are still menu items we have not tried because we got full early on. I don't understand why one YouTuber complained that he spent $140 for buffet but was still hungry afterwards because they didn't refill his food or fulfill most of his orders on time. We never experienced any of that both times we dined. And we felt the food was fantastic. But you have to try to see what you like. I didn't really like the sushi and sashimi platter from the $140 buffet menubut I enjoyed the sashimi that was in the buffet line instead. I thought the oxtail potstickers were average but all of their Wagyu Beef absolutely delicious and amazing. I could go on and on but you really need to try and what find what you like.

Arrived a few minutes late due to LA traffic - NikuX is located in the same building as the Intercontinental hotel in DTLA, on the second floor. Seated within 5 minutes in a nice window seat.\n\nWith the full-service menu, you get to order unlimited amounts of everything on the menu and some special items once.\n\nUnlimited items: some items require preparation and you need to order the day before your reservation, such as the 45-day aged tomahawk - which we ordered. When we sat down, we immediately ordered Japanese A5 ribeye and tenderloin.\n\nWhat we liked:\n- Japanese A5 steaks - sliced thin, good quality, not a lot in each serving but because of the heavy fat content it fills you up quickly!\n- Wagyu fried rice - whoever is working the wok on the rice is doing a great job!\n- Unlimited lobster tails and king crab legs at the buffet - served chilled on ice, but supplied with lemons and butter and very fresh. And they’ve cut the lobster tails in half to make it even easier to eat.\n- Miso Sea bass - served in “cubes” that were pan fried and served on a skewer. Very tasty\n\nNot fans of:\n- Shishito pepper\n\nThe special items (limited to one per person)\n- Sashimi special - uni, toro, salmon, caviar - what’s not to like? Very tasty. Small portion but it was very good. I had both portions for the two of us that went…yum!\n- King crab stuffed - served hot - very good\n- Big head shrimp - served hot - also very good\n\nBuffet - shrimp, other wagyu food options, like curry, fresh salad, vegetables, tempura - all unlimited and self-serve. Good selection.\n\nCocktails / wine - expansive menu - prices are about what you would expect for LA prices.\n\nService - Wissal was our server - very friendly - informative and professional. Thanks for a great time! In terms of the food service, honestly it was a bit slow. I know you get 2 hours to eat but we often sat 15-20 minutes with no steak despite ordering. That would probably be my only point of negative feedback. Quality was great. We left super full - but the long lag times to get cooked steak out on the full-service option was a bit disappointing. Next time, I might skip the full service and just get the self-service and cook my own meat over a Korean BBQ and take the wagyu they had at the buffet.\n\nNow - if you make it to the end and you still have room for dessert - you can try it. Their tiny dessert station didn’t have anything great in my opinion. We tried a few things and were underwhelmed. But hey - we were already bursting at the seams from all the Wagyu :)\n\nA must try!

That would probably be my only point of negative feedback. Quality was great. We left super full - but the long lag times to get cooked steak out on the full-service option was a bit disappointing. Next time, I might skip the full service and just get the self-service and cook my own meat over a Korean BBQ and take the wagyu they had at the buffet.\n\nNow - if you make it to the end and you still have room for dessert - you can try it. Their tiny dessert station didn’t have anything great in my opinion. We tried a few things and were underwhelmed. But hey - we were already bursting at the seams from all the Wagyu :)\n\nA must try!

                    "Context": "A must try experience - great quality meat and seafood!\n\nBooked full service for 2 ($139pp) on a Thursday night. Arrived a few minutes late due to LA traffic - NikuX is located in the same building as the Intercontinental hotel in DTLA, on the second floor. Seated within 5 minutes in a nice window seat.\n\nWith the full-service menu, you get to order unlimited amounts of everything on the menu and some special items once.\n\nUnlimited items: some items require preparation and you need to order the day before your reservation, such as the 45-day aged tomahawk - which we ordered. When we sat down, we immediately ordered Japanese A5 ribeye and tenderloin.\n\nWhat we liked:\n- Japanese A5 steaks - sliced thin, good quality, not a lot in each serving but because of the heavy fat content it fills you up quickly!\n- Wagyu fried rice - whoever is working the wok on the rice is doing a great job!\n- Unlimited lobster tails and king crab legs at the buffet - served chilled on ice, but supplied with lemons and butter and very fresh. And they’ve cut the lobster tails in half to make it even easier to eat.\n- Miso Sea bass - served in “cubes” that were pan fried and served on a skewer. Very tasty\n\nNot fans of:\n- Shishito pepper\n\nThe special items (limited to one per person)\n- Sashimi special - uni, toro, salmon, caviar - what’s not to like? Very tasty. Small portion but it was very good. I had both portions for the two of us that went…yum!\n- King crab stuffed - served hot - very good\n- Big head shrimp - served hot - also very good\n\nBuffet - shrimp, other wagyu food options, like curry, fresh salad, vegetables, tempura - all unlimited and self-serve. Good selection.\n\nCocktails / wine - expansive menu - prices are about what you would expect for LA prices.\n\nService - Wissal was our server - very friendly - informative and professional.

This guy is a natural and should be walking the restaurant on top of being upfront. With the diverse crowd he needs a promotion!\n\nThe food was excellent! I don’t understand the few poor reviews. I mean for $99 the selection you receive is fantastic. Couldn’t even get close to trying all the selections. I just focused on the delicious king crab, lobster, White Sea bass, sashimi and Wagyu. I wish I had an extra stomach, but had to tap out a happy camper.\n\nThank you again Daniel for your excellent customer service.  I will be back again soon, Nikux!

Originally our reservation was for the $99 option but we decided to do the $139 instead (unfortunately we did not get to do the tomahawk that is part of the $139 option as we needed to preorder by 1:30 PM). We waited about 5 minutes and were led to our giant table with a grill in the center. Mikey introduced himself to us as our server and he was cool, friendly and very attentive along with the other staff.\n\nTo start off there is the self-serve buffet style salad bar (NIKU salad, mushrooms & zucchini for grilling, seafood salad, kimchi, fruit), then the crudo bar (wagyu tartare, bluefin tuna toro w/ scallion, salmon, A5 wagyu tartare, amberjack, halibut, scallop, ceviche), then the hot foods (white rice topped with furikake, wagyu curry, wagyu mapo tofu, fried veggies, shrimp tempura and then the meat locker (Japanese A5 chef's choice steak, Japanese A5 top sirloin, American Wagyu Ribeye, American Wagyu Striploin, American Wagyu Tenderloin) and then the chilled seafood (oysters, scallops, lobster tail, snow crab legs & king crab legs) and the condiments (lemon, cajun butter, pink peppercorn mignonette & yuzu cocktail sauce) and lastly a small dessert section.\n\nThere were items on the menu that you had to order through your server. We tried the potato pave, oxtail potstickers, A5 wagyu sando, miso Chilean sea bass, wagyu tallow shishito peppers, wagyu sukiyaki, and lamb lollipop. Because of the $139 option we were each allowed to order 1 item from the Chef's Special Seafood so we chose the ultimate sashimi platter (assorted sashimi, uni, foie gras, caviar) and sushi platter which was incredible. The quality of fish was very fresh, each piece of sushi was dabbed with a little sauce/tare and the slightly acidic vinegar rice was perfect and really opened up the appetite.\n\nThe meat what can I say? Every single piece melted in the mouth, after a slight sear on both sides of the beef and got great maillard reaction. You can season your meat with the condiments at the table  (salt, pepper, chili powder, wasabi salt, house blend, truffle salt). Our favorites were definitely the Japanese cuts, they were VERY rich and a little goes a long way but it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience throughout being able to enjoy small dishes of quality seafood from the crudo bar or some salad  in between the rich meat and most definitely the seafood... not many places offer king crab legs so this is legit, crab crackers and crab shears provided as well, the crab meat were both so naturally sweet with a bit of brininess from the salt water, id say the crab legs alone make it worth it, just go to Costco and take a look at the cooked red king crab legs.

                    "Context": "Had a reservation for 2 for Niku X on Friday night at 9:30 PM. Niku X is located in the Wilshire-Grand Building on the 2nd floor on the opposite side of the Intercontinenal Hotel. Found street parking on Figueroa & 6th. We took the escalators up and were about 20 minutes early, we were greeted by the hostess and led to the waiting area and given a drinks menu. Originally our reservation was for the $99 option but we decided to do the $139 instead (unfortunately we did not get to do the tomahawk that is part of the $139 option as we needed to preorder by 1:30 PM). We waited about 5 minutes and were led to our giant table with a grill in the center. Mikey introduced himself to us as our server and he was cool, friendly and very attentive along with the other staff.\n\nTo start off there is the self-serve buffet style salad bar (NIKU salad, mushrooms & zucchini for grilling, seafood salad, kimchi, fruit), then the crudo bar (wagyu tartare, bluefin tuna toro w/ scallion, salmon, A5 wagyu tartare, amberjack, halibut, scallop, ceviche), then the hot foods (white rice topped with furikake, wagyu curry, wagyu mapo tofu, fried veggies, shrimp tempura and then the meat locker (Japanese A5 chef's choice steak, Japanese A5 top sirloin, American Wagyu Ribeye, American Wagyu Striploin, American Wagyu Tenderloin) and then the chilled seafood (oysters, scallops, lobster tail, snow crab legs & king crab legs) and the condiments (lemon, cajun butter, pink peppercorn mignonette & yuzu cocktail sauce) and lastly a small dessert section.\n\nThere were items on the menu that you had to order through your server. We tried the potato pave, oxtail potstickers, A5 wagyu sando, miso Chilean sea bass, wagyu tallow shishito peppers, wagyu sukiyaki, and lamb lollipop. Because of the $139 option we were each allowed to order 1 item from the Chef's Special Seafood so we chose the ultimate sashimi platter (assorted sashimi, uni, foie gras, caviar) and sushi platter which was incredible. The quality of fish was very fresh, each piece of sushi was dabbed with a little sauce/tare and the slightly acidic vinegar rice was perfect and really opened up the appetite.\n\nThe meat what can I say? Every single piece melted in the mouth, after a slight sear on both sides of the beef and got great maillard reaction. You can season your meat with the condiments at the table  (salt, pepper, chili powder, wasabi salt, house blend, truffle salt).

Definitely order this one per person. Rich and unctuous, so good. Would love to have brought it home for my dog, but im from SF.

I think the flavors complemented each other very well, but knowing how a5 tastes by itself, it made me wanting more out of the dish a little. I wanted to taste the richness of the meat and I though that was lacking from the dish. The dish itself was great, but it felt like deep down I was missing something, since I know all of the ingredients separately.\n\nDrinks:\n\nThe Matcha Colada was great, especially if you like matcha. It was fresh matcha and definitely blended well with the coconut. I would recommend it for matcha lovers.\n\nThe margarita was probably one of the best margaritas that I have had ANYWHERE in LA. It was that good. Definitely a 10/10 for me.\n\nUme Raba was good, but my 3rd ranked from the bunch. It was refereshing, but not really my style.\n\nAs a bonus, they serve oolong tea as a palette cleanser mid-meal, which was great. I will unashamedly admit I had 4 cups of tea.\n\nDessert:\n\nMatcha dessert was super rich, but delicious. I liked it a lot. It was similar to a matcha ice cream, with powdered matcha around it. My girlfriend thought the matcha flavor was too rich, though I thought it was perfect.\n\nThe creme brûlée was the better of the two dishes as was the textbook definition of an ideal dessert in my opinion. Only only downside is that it is pretty small.\n\nService:\n\nService was tip tier, like you would find in a Michelin restaurant. The servers were knowledgeable and friendly, especially about the dishes and what they were preparing for us.\n\nOverall:\n\nThe food was all top tier and I have no doubt that this place will receive a Michelin Star in the near future. If someone asked me what I wanted to eat every day for the rest of my life, it would be this place. I would happily do so.\n\nI now dream to do the tomahawk experience next. Hopefully sometime soon.

If you haven't been, it is also a must try when you're in sin city!\n\nLocated on the 2nd floor of the Intercontinental hotel. You won't get lost, there's a bunch of signs telling you where to go via escalator or elevator.\n\nWe got the Yakiniku Tasting Menu which includes appetizers, yakiniku, and dessert. Every dish was very decadent and umami from start to finish -- the uni, caviar and wagyu tartare dish to the different types of wagyu from the US, Australia, and Japan. You'll leave wanting more of the toriyama sandwich with foie gras and milk bread.\n\nBesides the food, the vibe and the service by Mama J was phenomenal - she was funny and also attentive to make our experience one-of-a-kind.

I even mentioned that it was our first time, but we were still left totally confused about how it all worked. Instead of helping or offering any recommendations, he just kept pushing the potstickers and asked if we wanted rice because it would “go well” with what we already had. Since he kept suggesting the potstickers, we figured we’d give them a try—but they never even came.\n\nI ordered the Yakisuki thinking it’d be something cool to try, but it didn’t come with the egg yolk dip, which made it feel incomplete. Honestly, the whole experience felt like if you didn’t already know what to order, too bad—the server wasn’t going to guide you.\n\nAfter the meal, I did some research and realized I missed out on a bunch of items I would’ve liked to try.

Probably not Maine lobster. (C) The A-5 Wagyu Ribeye cannot compete with Ruth’s Chris’ Non-Wagyu Ribeye. (D) The buffet selection was very limited. (E) The soup however, was surprisingly great.

                    "Context": "This restaurant was a major disappointment. I cannot believe that my parents and I spent $500 only to receive such poor service. On multiple occasions, I had to get up from the table because our server was nowhere to be found. We repeatedly asked for the table to be cleared, yet it remained cluttered throughout the meal. To make matters worse, the desserts were brought out while the table was still in the same state, as shown in the attached photo—further reflecting the lack of attention to service.\n\nI chose the highest-tier buffet option, which is advertised as including premium Japanese beef cuts. However, the seafood selection was extremely underwhelming. The so-called King Crab was completely tasteless and appeared to have been frozen for a long time. As shown in the photos, the crab legs were unusually thin and lacked any substantial meat, making it clear that they had been stored frozen for an extended period. The same applies to the entire seafood bar.\n\nRegarding the Japanese beef cuts, I have been to Japan over ten times and dined at no fewer than six reputable steak houses. Based on my experience, the beef served here was clearly frozen, and its quality was mediocre at best. While the restaurant claims to offer A5-grade meat, I find that highly unlikely. I have had A5 beef on numerous occasions, and while these cuts may indeed be Japanese, they do not meet the standards of true A5 quality.\n\nThe service was equally disappointing. Beyond the lack of attentiveness, the dessert—a simple Häagen-Dazs ice cream—was served in its original packaging with plastic spoons, showing a complete disregard for presentation. This level of service and quality might be acceptable at a $30-per-person establishment, but certainly not at a restaurant charging over $150 per person.\n\nI hope this review helps others make an informed decision and avoid an experience that falls far short of expectations.

I think it felt even more greasy because there were no vegetables or refreshing flavors to go with the grill. I saw oysters and scrubs on YouTube, but they weren't there the day I went. The lobster was hard to eat because the shell didn't separate because they cooked it somehow. The king crab wasn't high quality, but it was all small and low quality and not very edible, so it was a bit disappointing. You have to call 24 hours in advance for dry-aged meat. The atmosphere is good, but the servers are busy and they bring it a bit late when you order. It's a bit disappointing because there's nothing worth eating for the price.

As a group of eight, we booked the full-service option and arrived at 8:30 PM for our 8:45 reservation. Despite arriving early, we weren’t seated until 9 PM, which was frustrating and set the tone for the evening.\n\nOnce seated, things only got worse. The grill at our table was broken, and we were told there was no other table available to accommodate us. Since we paid for the full-service option, we weren’t even allowed to grill our own meat, which we would have preferred given the circumstances.\n\nThe service was painfully slow. It took over an hour for the first round of our limited 15 items to arrive, leaving us with little time to enjoy the meal within the 2-hour limit. The presentation of the meat was subpar—cuts were not well-prepared or what you'd expect from a high-end restaurant.\n\nThe most disappointing part was the quality of the food. The A5 wagyu beef from our second order was chewy and lacked the signature tenderness you’d expect from wagyu. It was so poor that we questioned whether it was even wagyu at all.\n\nWhile some staff members were polite, the overall experience was not worth the $1,500 we paid. Waiting for food, dealing with a broken grill, and being unable to enjoy the meal as promised made for a truly disappointing evening. We won’t be returning and can’t recommend this restaurant.

This restaurant  most definitely underdelivered for the $139 that they were charging. As a family, we eat fresh seafood regularly. So, we know what freshness tastes like. Perhaps it was the Thanksgiving long weekend and their suppliers had hard time delivering fresh seafood, or perhaps the restaurant's latest delivery was the day before Thanksgiving, when we visited the restaurant on Saturday, the seafood simply tasted unfresh. Many fish dishes had a mushy/slimy texture to them, and the shrimps/lobsters tasted unusually plain. The A5 Wagyu beef was tender, but they were all served on a large cold plate. By the time they were delivered to our table, the Wagyu pieces were all lukewarm. And eating beef with high fat content at a lukewarm temperature was definitely not an enjoyment, and even the Wagyu fried rice was lukewarm when served. The manager did come out and apologize, which was a nice gesture. I might try this restaurant again in the future, but will definitely avoid long weekend at all cost. BTW, I tried to scan the receipt using their Chubby app to accumulate points in the parking garage, but the app said it could only scan while we were physically inside the restaurant. So, for those of you who wish to use their app to accumulate points, please make sure to do so before you leave their premises.\n\nUpdate: I had to down grade their food from 2 stars to 1 because both my older son and I had a miserable night last night after we came home.

If you want cheaper AYCE wagyu/sushi, I think driving to one of their sister restaurants is more cost efficient (such as Yumiyaki, Mikiya, or even Chubby Cattle). Those other restaurants are cheaper and judging by how they serve sushi and Japanese Wagyu also, it's better to get those dishes there than pay a butt load for this place.\n\nWe got the upgraded option of $139, and opted out to order any large steaks that you pre- order (ex. tomahawks range from 35-40 oz, and some other options that you can select of your choosing.\n\nService: Extremely horrendous. I had runners/staff members not even know the simple aspect of having certain condiments at their restaurant. One runner said they didn't have tabasco, but had chili oil; only for a FOH manager to come by and say they have no tabasco and chili oil. Our server kept getting our orders wrong which caused a delay in our meat being served because we were sat at a non-grill table. Our server admitted to getting the orders wrong completely. Wait was over 15-20 minutes long in between waiting for the next round. Runners/servers also kept serving dishes on the side of the table even if there was room in the middle of the table. Dishes were not cleaned up. I had almost 4 plates stacked just from appetizers because I was starving between rounds of meat never coming essentially.\n\nAmbiance: The restaurant is nice, but with the amount of complaining tables surrounding our area, I definitely didn't think that I was at a high end semi fancy restaurant at all.

If you want to order drinks, remember, they are extra, and the staff won't tell you! The only difference between the 99 and 139 yuan buffets is that you can only order one of four dishes per person, and each serving only contains two pieces of food. Almost all the seafood was very stale; the only decent thing was the cake. We had to find a server three times and waited over ten minutes to pay the bill. A truly awful experience!

Absolutely disgusting!!!\n\nAs for the service, it was also atrocious!! Once we were sat, we ordered waters for the table and a kids cup for my son. My wife and I received our water but our son’s never came so we asked again. Wait 20min, still no water so we ask again. We wait again no one comes to the table to check on us or asks if we need anything until 20min later when a bus boy comes around and asks and we finally got the water for my son 40minutes after we got ours. After this, I walked to the host stand to speak to the manager about how we were upset about the food/water situation and was told that a manager would be sent over but guess what? No manager ever showed. We then asked for our check through the bus boy and waited roughly 15min before asking again because no one ever brought it. A manager was finally brought our check and we made him aware of the situation. Manager was very apologetic and offered to comp one of our meals.\n\nI would never visit this establishment again nor would I ever recommend it.\n\nSTAY AWAY AND EAT ELSEWHERE!!!!!

Checked this place out because of the buzz on social media.\n\nWe arrived at our designated reservation time and were told it’s going to be a short wait because they are just cleaning tables. I had to check three times with the front desk only to be seated after 45 minutes because the front of house had to set up our table herself.\n\nNow for the buffet selection, some items were already out of stock like oysters and fried rice. The steaks also took time to replenish. Very disappointed that they also ran out of the A5 wagyu which is one of the main reasons people go to this place. From the hot menu, the lamb chop and katsu sandwich (which is what most people talk about online) were also sold out!\n\nThe service left much to be desired as well as our drinks took forever to arrive and when we asked for another round of iced tea — they ran out (how does this happen?).\n\nWill probably not go back after this experience.

We assumed it would be a 10-15 minute wait but 30 minutes had already passed before any type of update. We spoke to one of the front managers and he had apologized for the wait but did not have an estimated time for the next available table. He offered us the regular menu to order some appetizers while we were still waiting in the lobby, so we had placed an order for 2 Japanese Albacore with Crispy Onion handrolls to tide over our appetite. We were waiting roughly for 10-15 minutes for our order, but thankfully we were called for an open table.\n\nWe were finally seated at 8:15pm and immediately placed our food order for the DineLA menu. We received our first order of the crudo along with our order of the 2 albacore handrolls at 8:22pm. We quickly devoured those 2 items after waiting an hour to be seated. We were waiting on our next course but we did not receive it until 8:49pm. We received our Dashi Yukke Soup at a warm but not hot temperature and 27 minutes after our first course.\n\nAt this point, we were extremely hungry and disappointed in the level of execution and service at the restaurant. To wait nearly 30 minutes in between each course was completely absurd. If we continued with the same pace, our dinner would last 2 hours and we would end our dinner at 10pm. We spoke with the manager and he apologized for the wait and offered to ask the chef if they could expedite the rest of our menu. We then got the rest of the menu (Chimichurri Bone Marrow and A5 Wagyu Yakiniku) 10 minutes later. We also received the Fried Brussel Sprouts on the house.\n\nTo conclude dinner, they also sent over 2 desserts. We appreciated that they were able to comp the handrolls, brussel sprouts, and desserts for all the inconvenience. Once we received the check, the manager came over again to apologize for the wait and offered us a 15% service discount. We left the restaurant after paying.\n\nI started feeling some stomach pains once we left the restaurant. I confided with my friend who I had ate with and she had also had slight stomach pains. On my drive home, I started to feel nauseous and knew it was definitely from something I had eaten. My friend later confided in me that she started feeling the same way around 4am. We felt horrible and found out that we both got food poisoning. We both concluded that it must have been something we had both eaten at the restaurant since we both had similar symptoms. We are both extremely disappointed in the whole experience given that Niku X holds such a high standard for food and experience.

One of the dishes we ordered was sashimi platter. After putting the dish on the table, explaining the platter, the waiter from the kitchen, accidentally touched/ poked the food. He tried to laugh off by saying “ahahahahh,… oh my gosh~~ I’m so sorryyyy~.” Then he walked away. It’s a lawsuit. The fact that he touched a raw fish then walked away laughing without even offering to bring out a fresh new plate was the first red flag.\n\nAnd to continue with the sashimi, it was the worst sashimi I had in my life. Not only was it not fresh, the color, texture, the way it was sliced… the food was done at a level that could have been done by a teenager at home.\n\nThen when entrees started coming out, the waitress came over to move around plates on the table to make some space. As she was doing so, she spilled a bowl of soy sauce on the table and into my wasabi bowl. The sauce nearly missed my white jacket. When I asked the waitress to wipe the soy sauce, she said she will get it wiped without even an apology.\n\nLastly the $180 kobe striploin was such a waste of money. 40% was fat, not even from marbling, but just excessive fat that should have been taken care of in the kitchen.\n\nOut of five dishes we ordered, we only finished one, which was wagyu tartare. Wagyu fried rice, we didn’t even attempt to taste it as it looked like a microwaved frozen beef rice.\n\nAt last the manager came over to ask what was unsatisfying about the meal. When I told him everything including some other details not included in this review, he took the two plates of sashimi and the wagyu fried rice out from the check.\n\nSimultaneously he gave me his business card saying the next time I make a visit he will provide special course menu + explained how some of their sashimis are dry aged, causing them to not “look” fresh. Listen, this isn’t my first day on this planet eating dry aged sashimi. The fact that the manager tried to cover up the whole unsettling experience with his story of dry aged sashimi shows he himself doesn’t have the basics down as for a manager.\n\nIt is very hard to believe that this restaurant is even on the Michelin guide.

The earliest available weekend slot for a party of four was late December, so I waited almost three months for this visit. I was really looking forward to it.\n\nBut maybe my expectations were too high. I thought we would have a table where we could grill the meat ourselves, but our seats were at the bar near the windows. The ventilation was excellent, but it caused the meat to cool down very quickly, and we ended up eating everything cold.\n\nAnother disappointing point was the lack of customization for how the meat was cooked. I prefer medium-rare, while my group prefers well-done, but I had no choice but to eat everything well-done. If we had been seated at a grilling table, I would have ordered medium-rare and cooked it to my preference.\n\nWhen asked why I didn’t complain, it’s because it was my first visit, and I assumed the seating was assigned and grilling tables weren’t an option for us. However, my friends later told me that they were able to grill their meat and enjoy it warm. It was disappointing, especially after waiting three months for this experience.\n\nWe ordered the $139menu, but due to the holiday season, the price had increased by $10.\n\nThat said, the service was exceptional. The servers were attentive, offering sample dishes, small cocktails, and even soju, which made the experience fun. The bar was clean, and the sushi and crab were absolutely delicious.\n\nIn conclusion, while the meat was disappointing, the other aspects of the meal were satisfying. If you plan to visit, I recommend opting for the $99 menu instead.

There was an extreme lack of side dishes that you would  expect of a buffet. There was no fruit and very little vegetable options. Dessert options sucked. This meant you had nothing to balance out the extremely fatty cuts. Maybe it’s because they were not originally designed to be a buffet so they had very little space to spread the food items available for self-service, but the result is one feel almost sickened by the heaviness of the meal at the end of it.\n\nThey were also blasting k-pop music which, while I normally enjoy, did not really help in creating a “premium” experience because they were intentionally picked to be upbeat and high-speed songs. These songs are more suited for a bar or fast food setting and I felt like the choice was to rush customers out of the door.\n\nService left me a little confused. Everyone was professional, but they did not have an option for coat check in a closet when the entire restaurant is very smoky from the grill. The seating was also pretty weird; if you go as two people you have to sit next to each other which can become pretty crowded."

Maybe it’s because they were not originally designed to be a buffet so they had very little space to spread the food items available for self-service, but the result is one feel almost sickened by the heaviness of the meal at the end of it.\n\nThey were also blasting k-pop music which, while I normally enjoy, did not really help in creating a “premium” experience because they were intentionally picked to be upbeat and high-speed songs. These songs are more suited for a bar or fast food setting and I felt like the choice was to rush customers out of the door.\n\nService left me a little confused. Everyone was professional, but they did not have an option for coat check in a closet when the entire restaurant is very smoky from the grill. The seating was also pretty weird; if you go as two people you have to sit next to each other which can become pretty crowded."

He is a seafood foodie so it was one of his special birthday requests to fly to LA and eat here. The atmosphere was dimly lit, kind of intimate in appearance however you are seated with others and not at a private table. The music was a bit loud so conversation had to be louder. We had an amazing waiter JJ who was nothing but TOP NOTCH all night long!! The food was not worth the price unfortunately 😕. The seafood was cold seafood. I'm used to my crab legs being hot and boiled with flavor. My husband loves all kinds hot or cold seafood and he said it was sub par. The Wagyu Beef requires a special pallette because it was very greasy. And the desserts were not sweet at all and were just horrible. I felt really cheated on what was supposed to be a superior experience! And for the cost of this experience....when you travel this far for a birthday experience....well let's just say I am super disappointed. Our waiter sent over the manager, who was super nice and very understanding, provided an alternative for food options, however we were really already over it. He provided us a 60$ discount which still made the experience cost 160$ plus the 16.50 for parking. I do not recommend this experience unless you specifically like cold seafood and wagyu beef. But i will always recommend JJ our waiter! Thank you guys and hope this helps! Food: 1 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 3\n\nFood: 1\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 3"

We’re also big fans of the shrimp and lobster tails—always fresh and satisfying. Don’t miss the Miso Chilean Seabass wrap (ordered separately)—a buttery, melt-in-your-mouth bite that’s absolutely worth it.\n\nWe first met Cody at the Little Tokyo Chubby Cattle location and were happy to see him here. He always makes us feel welcome—like a friend ensuring we enjoy every aspect of the meal. Wilson was our main server and was fantastic throughout—attentive, professional, and warm.\n\nOne note: premium seafood items like king crab and lobster tails are replenished on a schedule. At this price point, continuous availability would be more fitting. Also, pre-shelled lobster tail would improve the overall dining ease.\n\nWe’ve been Chubby Club members for a few months now, and it’s a great value for those who dine here often. Valet parking with validation is currently $24 (up from $16.50 nine months ago), still reasonable considering the regular $54 rate without validation.\n\nReservations are highly recommended—use OpenTable to secure a spot.

The wagyu was fantastic, the seafood was mostly very delicious, and the sides that you order from the kitchen were all very good as well. Being a huge seafood fan, I was primarily interested in eating the various fish and shellfish options. While I really enjoyed 90% of the seafood selection, I will say that the crab and lobster were a bit underwhelming. One of the crabs (can't remember which kind) was very salty, while the lobster had a somewhat rubbery texture. Aside from the seafood, the beef options were all fantastic and melt-in-your-mouth. The cocktails were well-made and delicious, but seemed light on alcohol. We also ordered a couple of soft drinks, which were fairly expensive and not a good value ($6 for a tiny glass bottle of Coke). The service was very good throughout the entire dining experience and I was impressed that the servers came to change our grill often without us asking. The primary reason I am taking off a star from my review is that our server essentially bribed us into giving him a good review on Yelp by offering to comp our soft drinks. I assumed that meant we could write him a good review on our own terms, but instead he took our phones, copied and pasted an AI-generated review on Yelp, and asked us to post it. It was honestly quite uncomfortable and it makes me question how legitimate the other reviews are for this establishment. Just something to be aware of. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the meal and would recommend Niku X to other seafood and wagyu lovers.

Arrived a few minutes late due to LA traffic - NikuX is located in the same building as the Intercontinental hotel in DTLA, on the second floor. Seated within 5 minutes in a nice window seat.\n\nWith the full-service menu, you get to order unlimited amounts of everything on the menu and some special items once.\n\nUnlimited items: some items require preparation and you need to order the day before your reservation, such as the 45-day aged tomahawk - which we ordered. When we sat down, we immediately ordered Japanese A5 ribeye and tenderloin.\n\nWhat we liked:\n- Japanese A5 steaks - sliced thin, good quality, not a lot in each serving but because of the heavy fat content it fills you up quickly!\n- Wagyu fried rice - whoever is working the wok on the rice is doing a great job!\n- Unlimited lobster tails and king crab legs at the buffet - served chilled on ice, but supplied with lemons and butter and very fresh. And they’ve cut the lobster tails in half to make it even easier to eat.\n- Miso Sea bass - served in “cubes” that were pan fried and served on a skewer. Very tasty\n\nNot fans of:\n- Shishito pepper\n\nThe special items (limited to one per person)\n- Sashimi special - uni, toro, salmon, caviar - what’s not to like? Very tasty. Small portion but it was very good. I had both portions for the two of us that went…yum!\n- King crab stuffed - served hot - very good\n- Big head shrimp - served hot - also very good\n\nBuffet - shrimp, other wagyu food options, like curry, fresh salad, vegetables, tempura - all unlimited and self-serve. Good selection.\n\nCocktails / wine - expansive menu - prices are about what you would expect for LA prices.\n\nService - Wissal was our server - very friendly - informative and professional. Thanks for a great time! In terms of the food service, honestly it was a bit slow. I know you get 2 hours to eat but we often sat 15-20 minutes with no steak despite ordering. That would probably be my only point of negative feedback. Quality was great. We left super full - but the long lag times to get cooked steak out on the full-service option was a bit disappointing. Next time, I might skip the full service and just get the self-service and cook my own meat over a Korean BBQ and take the wagyu they had at the buffet.\n\nNow - if you make it to the end and you still have room for dessert - you can try it. Their tiny dessert station didn’t have anything great in my opinion. We tried a few things and were underwhelmed. But hey - we were already bursting at the seams from all the Wagyu :)\n\nA must try!

You can watch your meal being carefully prepared. It’s stunning.\n\nOur fantastic waiter Chaeho did a phenomenal job presenting each elegant dish and conversing with us throughout our meal. We felt at home with his personal stories and interesting insights. Our superb assistant waitress, Phoebe, who helped bring out some of the dishes was very professional and sweet. The entire staff at this restaurant are top quality professionals.\n\nOur first course, crudo, was very fresh and a perfect start to our meal. The astrea oscietra caviar, paired with senbei cracker and topped with gold leaf was astounding and a treat to the taste buds. I have never had such a beautiful visual as well as sensory moment. There was no heaviness, only pleasure with each bite. The black winter truffle was presented in a Louis Vuitton mini suitcase, and shaved onto the meat. Now I know what it feels like to be presented with an award!\n\nThe style and story behind each plate reflected the precision and passion of the kitchen. It’s obvious that the staff love what they do. I felt as though I was in an edible art gallery; the balance of texture and color was so artistic.\n\nMy favorite dish was the wagu platter, not just for the breathtaking display, but each cut of meat touched my tongue with intense flavor. To continue the journey, every course had a different palate cleanser with its own sensation.\n\nThe price is worth the entire experience. It is very special and one of a kind unique.

Every single time we ordered meat it came to our table cold. But because wagyu is so high in fat, the fat didn’t “melt in our mouth” it felt like we were chewing sticks of butter/lard. Dish after dish came this way. I was nearly about to lose my mind until we finally decided that we were both just done and ready to leave. That made me feel a lot better to just give up on the experience and decide to escape the place entirely.  The manager came by and asked if we were doing ok but it was only by the time we were about to ask for our check after the entire horrendous experience and leave. So he was too late. Nothing really happened after he heard about our experience. He said sorry and that he hoped he could make it right but we only had one more serving of meat left from our earlier order so there was really nothing he could have done except maybe make sure the last two tiny portions of meat don’t come out stone cold.\nTheir buffet food was very low quality, the service was super slow, and the price was really too high for what you get.\nAnyways, I highly recommend skipping this place and I’m really not sure how they have such high ratings. They do seem to have a strong social media presence. Maybe that has something to do with it. Please just beware and don’t get disappointed like we did!

Enjoying the cheaper menu at $109.00 will require an extra hour's wait, and most customers are willing to pay the $158.00 menu, which is nothing special, just with fewer annoying rules for ordering dishes.\nIf you intend to eat wagyu beef, you can accept the higher price, but if you want seafood like King Crab and lobster, I don't recommend this place. They removed scallops and oysters from the menu, so it's not worth submitting to so many rules like time limits and restricted dishes, etc.\nThe King Crab is served cold, which makes it quite tasteless, while the Snow Crab is served hot and was very tasty.\nIt's nothing more than a restaurant with unfavorable cost-benefit!\nLook for another place in Los Angeles that's like seafood, and you'll be much better served.

I think it felt even more greasy because there were no vegetables or refreshing flavors to go with the grill. I saw oysters and scrubs on YouTube, but they weren't there the day I went. The lobster was hard to eat because the shell didn't separate because they cooked it somehow. The king crab wasn't high quality, but it was all small and low quality and not very edible, so it was a bit disappointing. You have to call 24 hours in advance for dry-aged meat. The atmosphere is good, but the servers are busy and they bring it a bit late when you order. It's a bit disappointing because there's nothing worth eating for the price.

We tried the 14-course menu, and some pieces were okay, but nothing was great. Their Wagyu A4 was their best piece (really good). Although, for an unusual reason, they added Blueberry sauce to their A5, which DESTROYED the meat's taste. It reminded me of a blueberry pancake. Such a waste of good meat.\n\nThe drinks were all right, and we liked them. Ambiance 3 stars (it wasn't bad, nothing unique. they had some artwork on a wall), service 1 star (empty glasses of water, multiple dishes on the table, I don't even want to start with napkins and everything else), Value 1 star (it would be acceptable for around $150-$200 not for $400). Overall, 2,3 stars for a high-end restaurant.\n\nBtw if you are a vegetarian, don't get close to that place. They were dishonest about their offering (really disappointing). They charged the same price of $300ish ($400 with drinks/tip) for their veggie option (which wasn't even 5,6 courses compared to 14), and it was the worst veggie we had ever tried in any place in LA. We go to restaurants a lot. Most have been honest about their offering, for example, Mélisse Restaurant, 2 Michelin stars; when I called them, they said they were sorry but couldn't accommodate Vegetarians, and I appreciated their honesty. They didn't try to rob us.\n\nShould you go? If you have been to all high-end restaurants in LA, including Michelin restaurants (because that is what you are paying), and a lack of quality, service, and details doesn't bother you much, you can try this too.\n\nI pay $400, sometimes even more, in many restaurants (including 3-star Michelin worldwide), and I am okay with spending that money for experience and greatness. Not because I have too much money to burn, which I don't. I had great experiences (and also some disappointing ones) throughout my journey. This restaurant was one of my worst experiences in any high-end restaurant (above the $250 range).

What I found was something just shy of that.\n\nAmbiance & Service (4.5/5): The restaurant sits a few floors up, and our dinner with another couple started off smoothly—we were seated immediately with a reservation at a window table overlooking the street. The layout is thoughtfully arranged with enough space for movement and wheelchair access. It can host everything from small parties to large groups (we saw a table of ~20). The ambiance is upscale, modern, and lively, though the bathrooms felt underwhelming—small, limited stalls, and the trash was overflowing.\nService overall was attentive. Our waiter was friendly, offered great recommendations, and staff were quick to help when we accidentally spilled a drink—cleaning it up professionally and replacing it without question. Plenty of servers and even managers circulate the floor to assist. At this price point, I would have expected the premium cuts to be cooked table-side by staff rather than us, but that’s more of a missed opportunity than a dealbreaker.\n\nFood: The wagyu was solid—hard to get wrong, and I’d give it a 4.5/5 so long as cuts aren’t too thick or thin. Seafood, however, was mixed. The carpaccio was fresh and flavorful, but the king crab legs were small, dry, and more effort than reward. Bibs would have been a thoughtful touch given the mess factor. The snow crab legs, on the other hand, were the highlight of the night—we kept going back for more. Still, the overall spread left me wanting more variety, particularly in veggies, fruit, and dessert. At this price, I’d expect at least a fruit bar and a stronger dessert selection.\n\nOverall: Niku X delivers a refined dining experience with polished service and a strong ambiance, but at $150 a head, I expected a bit more across the board—especially on seafood variety and premium touches like tableside grilling. Worth a visit for the snow crab legs and the wagyu, but not quite the fully extravagant experience I anticipated.

The views out the window we were seated next to were absolutely phenomenal as well. The one critique I do have is the chairs were a bit uncomfortable which is unfortunate from such an expensive place and not something I've experienced from this groups other restaurants.

Niku X is located in the Wilshire-Grand Building on the 2nd floor on the opposite side of the Intercontinenal Hotel. Found street parking on Figueroa & 6th. We took the escalators up and were about 20 minutes early, we were greeted by the hostess and led to the waiting area and given a drinks menu. Originally our reservation was for the $99 option but we decided to do the $139 instead (unfortunately we did not get to do the tomahawk that is part of the $139 option as we needed to preorder by 1:30 PM). We waited about 5 minutes and were led to our giant table with a grill in the center. Mikey introduced himself to us as our server and he was cool, friendly and very attentive along with the other staff.\n\nTo start off there is the self-serve buffet style salad bar (NIKU salad, mushrooms & zucchini for grilling, seafood salad, kimchi, fruit), then the crudo bar (wagyu tartare, bluefin tuna toro w/ scallion, salmon, A5 wagyu tartare, amberjack, halibut, scallop, ceviche), then the hot foods (white rice topped with furikake, wagyu curry, wagyu mapo tofu, fried veggies, shrimp tempura and then the meat locker (Japanese A5 chef's choice steak, Japanese A5 top sirloin, American Wagyu Ribeye, American Wagyu Striploin, American Wagyu Tenderloin) and then the chilled seafood (oysters, scallops, lobster tail, snow crab legs & king crab legs) and the condiments (lemon, cajun butter, pink peppercorn mignonette & yuzu cocktail sauce) and lastly a small dessert section.\n\nThere were items on the menu that you had to order through your server. We tried the potato pave, oxtail potstickers, A5 wagyu sando, miso Chilean sea bass, wagyu tallow shishito peppers, wagyu sukiyaki, and lamb lollipop. Because of the $139 option we were each allowed to order 1 item from the Chef's Special Seafood so we chose the ultimate sashimi platter (assorted sashimi, uni, foie gras, caviar) and sushi platter which was incredible. The quality of fish was very fresh, each piece of sushi was dabbed with a little sauce/tare and the slightly acidic vinegar rice was perfect and really opened up the appetite.\n\nThe meat what can I say? Every single piece melted in the mouth, after a slight sear on both sides of the beef and got great maillard reaction. You can season your meat with the condiments at the table  (salt, pepper, chili powder, wasabi salt, house blend, truffle salt). Our favorites were definitely the Japanese cuts, they were VERY rich and a little goes a long way but it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience throughout being able to enjoy small dishes of quality seafood from the crudo bar or some salad  in between the rich meat and most definitely the seafood... not many places offer king crab legs so this is legit, crab crackers and crab shears provided as well, the crab meat were both so naturally sweet with a bit of brininess from the salt water, id say the crab legs alone make it worth it, just go to Costco and take a look at the cooked red king crab legs. I didn't try any of the desserts or hot food items except for the wagyu fried rice and shrimp tempura but I'll definitely be back to enjoy the full experience, hopefully with an earlier reservation time.\n\nAlso, this is a restaurant part of the Chubby Group (Chubby Cattle, Chubby Curry, Wagyu House, Yumiyaki, Mikiya, Chubby Skewers) so make sure you get the app and points!

Our server was very friendly, which I love in a course meal, being able to chat with them during the experience. The only downside of the space is that the restaurant was playing upbeat music which was loud. It was a bit bothersome and was hard to hear the servers explaining each course.\nOnto the food, I highly recommend the course meals because these are experiences designed from beginning to last and they give you a full experience. I chose the lower priced menu because the starters felt more appealing, and they definitely hit the spot. All the dishes throughout the night are very rich, overflowing with umami flavors from ingredients like truffle, Wagyu, and egg yolk. At the same time, the chefs at Niku X know to pair these fatty beef cuts with acidic garnishes like lemon and ume, which helps balance out the intensity. I can nitpick a few things, but that is after understanding that the whole meal was amazing. With the tenderloin, they present it on a small, soft slice of bread and this portion was hard to eat without it all falling apart. The sukiyaki had a whole shiso leaf with it to eat, and that was overbearing over the rest of the ingredients.\nIf you are looking for a premium dinner experience, definitely look to Niku X to be pampered with an incredibly enjoyable night.

We made a reservation a week in advance and were seated promptly by the window with a great view.\n\nWe ordered only from the A La Carte menu because we wanted to have more control over our dining experience.\n\nStarted off with the Oxtail & Wagyu Potstickers and the Wagyu Tartare. The potstickers were tasty and had a lot of savory/umami/citrus notes. The tartare was a completely new experience for both of us as we'd never eaten raw beef before. It was seasoned really well and the texture wasn't off putting. Quail egg was a great touch.\n\nNext we were served our choices of meat: Masami Outside Skirt Wagyu, Miyazaki Tri Tip, and Stone Axe Short Rib. The wagyu was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and a favorite for both of us. The other two cuts were slightly more tough to chew, but sooo flavorful and buttery. The server gave us pairing recommendations for the condiments & meat.\n\nThe star of the show was truly the Dry Aged Masami Strip Loin. We got an 8 oz. portion instead of 6 oz. due to our order being put in incorrectly. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare!\n\nFinally ended our dinner with the Wagyu Fried Rice. This was tasty and had flavor components that a traditional fried rice wouldn't have. Lots of citrus notes and the egg presentation was beautiful. The wagyu bits were cut up so tiny though, it made me forget there was wagyu in the dish at all.\n\nLastly, they treated us to two complimentary desserts! We got the matcha pillow and the crème brûlée. The matcha pillow is just matcha ice cream, but I could tell the matcha quality was very good. The crème brûlée wasn't anything special but it was good!\n\nI'm subtracting 1-star because I do think they're still getting into the swing of things, as they haven't officially had a grand opening yet. For first timers, I think there could have been a bit more assistance with explaining the menu beforehand - we had to ask the waiter for recommendations! The format of the meat grilling felt a little awkward at times because the server was just standing there watching us eat. And as I mentioned earlier, there was a misunderstanding with the order, so the strip loin and fried rice weren't put in until we asked about it later. We fortunately didn't have to pay for parking because we didn't drive, but I do think the $16.50 fee for parking valet is a bit ridiculous for how much you're paying to eat. Overall though this made for a perfect date night and our waiter Meng was fantastic! I really appreciated when he brought out the strip loin and he told us to start video recording because the steak reveal was so grand!

The meat was overly fatty (not same as wagyu that we had in Japan), and the crab was excessively salty, almost as if it was intentionally overseasoned to discourage eating too much.\nInitially, I thought $149 was reasonable for high-quality meat, crab, and lobster, but we ended up with portions that felt worth only about $30. Even as someone who doesn’t eat large portions, I couldn’t enjoy more than a few bites. I’m writing this review to save others time and money.

I commend the Manager's patience to explain that it takes 3 hours to prepare the tomahawk and so requires the reservation. I told him that I drove 500 miles to dine there and see if he can help find a solution. He was patient but can't offer any solutions. Sigh... He did ask if there is anything he can do to make my stay more pleasant, please let him know. Hmmm... although sincere, but no real solution and no hard offers. Hey, a $5 discount coupon or some concession of something can ease my displeasure of the establishment (whether it is corporate or the operator that made the mistake for my predicament of not getting the meal I intended to have). Another solution is to start cooking another tomahawk at 6:30pm for the 9:30 client and provide the spare for me.\nThey close at midnight. Hey, I'm not manager to offer solutions.

I'll bet you can't find it.\nThen, some of my comments similar to this here are censored (deleted) in the feedback section! I don't know if the same person or other company person did the censoring. Why ask for feedback when censoring? And I'm locked out for 24 hours in commenting. So, here I am.\nAs for the server Nate, excellent 5+ stars service. Patient in hearing my orders; gives great recommendations and offers different ways to enjoy my meal. Michelin Star service.\nThe company should give him bonuses!\nFood & drinks: 3 stars summary\nSince I didn't get my intended meal of sit down served meal of tomahawk plus seafood & appetizers. -2 stars\n\nFruity cocktail was offered & accepted. Excellent tastes with the lychee infused alcoholic drink.\n(3.0 stars.)\nMeat & seafood (3 stars)\nA5 steaks... filet, rib eye, ny steak all excellent quality ... 4 stars rounded down to 3 stars. And I have to cook it myself on the grill. Grill fire is quite high and not adjustable, so it's hard to cook it correctly (-1 star). Nate (server) suggested that I let the kitchen cook it. It's better but still not the best. For the buffet review: the cooked seafood quality was 3 stars ... limited in variety and bland. Lobster tail was cold & I had to put in the grill to heat it up (2 stars). Perhaps some sauce can be provided besides hot butter? The sashimi of tuna, hamachi & salmon are pretty good. (3.5 stars).\nSide dishes & appetizers & dessert & coffee shishito peppers very good with right sauce\n4 stars\nSeabass lettuce wrap... yummy but not can be tastier or wrapped better 3.5 stars\nOxtail pot stickers... meat inside is too dry.\nSauce was nice . 1 star\nMatcha cheesecake 1 star the other \"x\" cheesecake 3 stars\nEspresso $8 is too acidic... 1 star\nWagyu taco is tasty 3 stars\nShrimp uni taco 3 stars\nWagyu fried rice 3.5 stars Food: 3 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 2\n\nFood: 3\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 2"

I thought From Chef would be special, so I ordered a few, but except for the lobster tail, there's nothing that's \"wow~ delicious\", and I'm so full that it's hard to eat anything else, so I don't recommend it. I think it felt even more greasy because there were no vegetables or refreshing flavors to go with the grill. I saw oysters and scrubs on YouTube, but they weren't there the day I went. The lobster was hard to eat because the shell didn't separate because they cooked it somehow. The king crab wasn't high quality, but it was all small and low quality and not very edible, so it was a bit disappointing. You have to call 24 hours in advance for dry-aged meat. The atmosphere is good, but the servers are busy and they bring it a bit late when you order. It's a bit disappointing because there's nothing worth eating for the price.

We spoke to one of the front managers and he had apologized for the wait but did not have an estimated time for the next available table.

We spoke with the manager and he apologized for the wait and offered to ask the chef if they could expedite the rest of our menu. We then got the rest of the menu (Chimichurri Bone Marrow and A5 Wagyu Yakiniku) 10 minutes later. We also received the Fried Brussel Sprouts on the house.\n\nTo conclude dinner, they also sent over 2 desserts. We appreciated that they were able to comp the handrolls, brussel sprouts, and desserts for all the inconvenience. Once we received the check, the manager came over again to apologize for the wait and offered us a 15% service discount.

I’m surprised Chef Shin Thompson held a previous Michelin Star & overlooked the service. I never write reviews but last night’s service really pains me.\n\nService: Generous 1/5\n\n1. Our menus when we sat down were bent and dirty (they’re printed on cardstock I’ve bought at Michael’s). The courses also don’t follow the order of what comes out which was confusing\n2. They don’t have purse or coat hooks so i was already like huh?? My purse fell on the floor & our jackets fell like 3x\n3. Food Pacing- they dropped 4 dishes at once so by the time it was time for our soup, it was barely luke warm. Also, why don’t they have soup spoons? It was SO HARD to drink the soup. Bevel was so wide you couldn’t sip from the bowl.\n4. They never changed our utensils. I had to ask constantly & they often left me without a knife … at a yakiniku restaurant. Also, I’m not going to slice into a beautiful cut of beef with a knife covered in fish juices or blueberry jam?\n5. They put the scallop onto a plate with trash on it hahahah (leftover lemon from the dish prior)\n6. When our server opened the box for the beef she walked away without even explaining what was what. I had to ask someone else walking by. This blew my mind & I have video of it. I spent majority of my dinner listening to the server at the table next to us. He did a much better job.

I’m surprised Chef Shin Thompson held a previous Michelin Star & overlooked the service. I never write reviews but last night’s service really pains me.\n\nService: Generous 1/5\n\n1. Our menus when we sat down were bent and dirty (they’re printed on cardstock I’ve bought at Michael’s). The courses also don’t follow the order of what comes out which was confusing\n2. They don’t have purse or coat hooks so i was already like huh?? My purse fell on the floor & our jackets fell like 3x\n3. Food Pacing- they dropped 4 dishes at once so by the time it was time for our soup, it was barely luke warm. Also, why don’t they have soup spoons? It was SO HARD to drink the soup. Bevel was so wide you couldn’t sip from the bowl.\n4. They never changed our utensils. I had to ask constantly & they often left me without a knife … at a yakiniku restaurant. Also, I’m not going to slice into a beautiful cut of beef with a knife covered in fish juices or blueberry jam?\n5. They put the scallop onto a plate with trash on it hahahah (leftover lemon from the dish prior)\n6. When our server opened the box for the beef she walked away without even explaining what was what. I had to ask someone else walking by. This blew my mind & I have video of it. I spent majority of my dinner listening to the server at the table next to us. He did a much better job.

We had the $159/person menu Without Grill on table  although the menu we got as well as the web clearly says $149/person( kind of misleading). First round we tried the JP A5 Ribeyes and Striploin which both melts in your mouth with an aroma that is indeed A grade JP Wagyu beef. We also grab some crab legs from the station and crab meat is warm and fresh. Everything seems to be good for the first 30 minutes and then things went south. It took them 30 minutes to get the 2nd round of the Wagyu steak from the kitchen AFTER we complained to the waiter for wait 20 minutes for nothing. Although the waiter and the manager did manage to get the steak speed up later on, even offering free drinks, we ended up with lots of Wagyu steaks on the table at the same time and it soon became too overwhelming while eating too much oily steak for such a short period of time. Till the end, we realized that we never even get the lobster tail we ordered earlier while they will never forget your appetizers. As for the dessert, they have a limited selection of cake flavors. Make sure you order the ones you like in between the dining otherwise you might not be able to get the flavor you want at the end. Overall, crab labs are good, shrimp is okay,  sashimi is average but at least they all taste fresh. A5 Wagyu only the Premium 5 oz Wagyu Worth the try but not the special Wagyu cut. If you like seafood, just go with the basic menu option. If you want Wagyu, make sure you reserve the table WITH GRILL or you will get GRILLED. By the way, for the owner, you need to update your website about the pricing otherwise it is misleading for the table with or without a grill.

Our server, Nate, was excellent—he explained everything clearly, was always available to take our order, and ensured our water glasses were never empty. Plates were promptly cleared, making for a smooth dining experience.\n\nThe atmosphere was decent—nothing particularly special or bad. Given that it’s a buffet, the atmosphere was upscaled.\n\nNow, onto the most important part: the food. Unfortunately, it didn’t live up to our expectations, especially considering the price. The Alaskan King Crab was particularly disappointing—it would be more accurate to call it “Alaskan Baby Crab.”\n\nOverall, while the service was great, the food didn’t justify the cost.

He is a seafood foodie so it was one of his special birthday requests to fly to LA and eat here. The atmosphere was dimly lit, kind of intimate in appearance however you are seated with others and not at a private table. The music was a bit loud so conversation had to be louder. We had an amazing waiter JJ who was nothing but TOP NOTCH all night long!! The food was not worth the price unfortunately 😕. The seafood was cold seafood. I'm used to my crab legs being hot and boiled with flavor. My husband loves all kinds hot or cold seafood and he said it was sub par. The Wagyu Beef requires a special pallette because it was very greasy. And the desserts were not sweet at all and were just horrible. I felt really cheated on what was supposed to be a superior experience! And for the cost of this experience....when you travel this far for a birthday experience....well let's just say I am super disappointed. Our waiter sent over the manager, who was super nice and very understanding, provided an alternative for food options, however we were really already over it. He provided us a 60$ discount which still made the experience cost 160$ plus the 16.50 for parking. I do not recommend this experience unless you specifically like cold seafood and wagyu beef.

Can use the valet directly.\n\nThis restaurant is under the same brand as  Xpot so the meat quality is great and maintained their usual standard. Specializing in wagyu, all meat is fatty with that perfect marble. The pickles side dish is a great balance.\n\nWe ordered Prix fixe menu and get to enjoy different cuts. The portion is alright. For 2 of us, we weren’t really full after the meal so we ordered another tomahawk tasting menu. But this one we couldn’t finish it all.\n\nAlthough the presentation is nice and interior design is fancy. I personally find it a bit overpriced. Some presentation is just for show and social media, I understand the marketing strategy but couldn’t appreciate it. It’s a good choice for celebration and events. They also have private dining space. But not so cost effective for day to day dining.

Crabs and lobsters are overcooked like you won't believe. Literally felt like biting my own finger when biting on the big head shrimp. However they don't gate keep their good stuff. All the seafood and waygu are at the buffet station. Love the no fuss buffet.\n\nBuffet station is small and make-shift from a bar/hallway. some of the beef and most of the \"filler\" type side dishes has to be ordered from the servers. It is confusing what needs to be ordered what's not, so we ended up didn't order much but just focused on the seafood and waygu at the buffet, which is good for us bad for their business lol. Types of sushi selection comes and goes at the buffet which is odd.\n\nGuest has no dress code. We dressed up but saw flipflops lol.

Very knowledgeable about the menu, both food and drinks and continued to help us pick great options. Daniel (I believe Im remembering his name right) at the host stand was also really nice and very accommodating when our table was taking longer to be ready than our reservation time.\n\nWe got the premium menu (priced at $159 pp; recently increased and not properly reflected on their whole website and certain physical menus) which included the seafood buffet and all of the steak cuts.  The steaks were all delicious, from the domestic Wagyu to the delicious JP A5, and the self serve seafood buffet was full enough that everyone could find something to enjoy. They also had restock times for some of the more popular items as well as utensils like seafood scissors and crab crackers which were necessities.\n\nI’d definitely take some time to consider what you’re going to want to get and when—like getting a buffet plate and enjoying what you got first before ordering some steak—so you don’t let certain foods get cold or cross flavors you may not have intended to, which was a slight issue I had figured may (and did) happen, but that didn’t take away from the food quality.\n\nGreat overall experience from the whole staff. I’d go again simply to enjoy the experience differently, maybe at one of the KBBQ style table grills or just ordering my dinner differently, but if you’re thinking about giving it a go and/or concerned about the price point, I’d say it’s worth your while at least once to see and judge for yourself !

We’re also big fans of the shrimp and lobster tails—always fresh and satisfying. Don’t miss the Miso Chilean Seabass wrap (ordered separately)—a buttery, melt-in-your-mouth bite that’s absolutely worth it.\n\nWe first met Cody at the Little Tokyo Chubby Cattle location and were happy to see him here. He always makes us feel welcome—like a friend ensuring we enjoy every aspect of the meal. Wilson was our main server and was fantastic throughout—attentive, professional, and warm.\n\nOne note: premium seafood items like king crab and lobster tails are replenished on a schedule. At this price point, continuous availability would be more fitting. Also, pre-shelled lobster tail would improve the overall dining ease.\n\nWe’ve been Chubby Club members for a few months now, and it’s a great value for those who dine here often. Valet parking with validation is currently $24 (up from $16.50 nine months ago), still reasonable considering the regular $54 rate without validation.\n\nReservations are highly recommended—use OpenTable to secure a spot. The dining experience is limited to 120 minutes, so plan accordingly.\n\nExceptional food, top-tier service, and a sleek, modern ambiance make Niku X a must-try. We’ll absolutely be back.

Another success from the chubby group :) . I’m obsessed!!! We made reservations both times , not sure how walk ins are like but I still highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time it does seem to get pretty busy. For the parking garage, I think you can self park sometimes but we valet both times. First time parking was full and they said valet only, second time, we just went straight to valet and the staff did mention it was also valet only . You get a 2 hour validation from the restaurant so parking will be $16.50 :) . Even the parking staff were immaculate.

It follows by a selection of raw Wagyu beef, then ending with the 'premium' seafood selection. While the apps and Wagyu selections were fresh and tasty, the seafood selections were nothing to be desired, tasting 'cheap' in comparison to the other options.\n\nService was on point! I had a server named Joe C, with another server helping named Wilson, always available or visible when needed but not overwhelmingly. The servers brought out additional meats that were cooked to perfection right at the table, with a detailed explanation of each type and the best way to enjoy with various sauces. Staff kept up with table maintenance, always asking to clear instead of removing dishes in a hurry.

The wagyu was fantastic, the seafood was mostly very delicious, and the sides that you order from the kitchen were all very good as well. Being a huge seafood fan, I was primarily interested in eating the various fish and shellfish options. While I really enjoyed 90% of the seafood selection, I will say that the crab and lobster were a bit underwhelming. One of the crabs (can't remember which kind) was very salty, while the lobster had a somewhat rubbery texture. Aside from the seafood, the beef options were all fantastic and melt-in-your-mouth. The cocktails were well-made and delicious, but seemed light on alcohol. We also ordered a couple of soft drinks, which were fairly expensive and not a good value ($6 for a tiny glass bottle of Coke). The service was very good throughout the entire dining experience and I was impressed that the servers came to change our grill often without us asking. The primary reason I am taking off a star from my review is that our server essentially bribed us into giving him a good review on Yelp by offering to comp our soft drinks. I assumed that meant we could write him a good review on our own terms, but instead he took our phones, copied and pasted an AI-generated review on Yelp, and asked us to post it. It was honestly quite uncomfortable and it makes me question how legitimate the other reviews are for this establishment. Just something to be aware of. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the meal and would recommend Niku X to other seafood and wagyu lovers.

Cocktail shrimps and shelled prawns were overcooked, Alaskan Crab legs seasoned well but also sadly overcooked. Lobster was cooked well. Sashimi was fresh.

But honestly, I think it was the better experience, even though it was our first time there and we missed out on being able to cook our own food. The bartenders Joseph (and I forgot the other guys name... sorry 😬) were awesome! They were so attentive and helpful in the food selection process. On top of that, they were great conversationalists and artists of concoctions. Even the other staff members that crossed our path were really cool. It was like we sat in the VIP area and were the only ones there! 😂 All the food was delicious and there were many top notch meat selections. The sea bass is a MUST try! 💋👌🏼 The vibe is casual but classy. (Heads up, though, they only play K-Pop so if you go I hope you're either a fan or don't mind.)

Thanks for a great time! In terms of the food service, honestly it was a bit slow. I know you get 2 hours to eat but we often sat 15-20 minutes with no steak despite ordering. That would probably be my only point of negative feedback. Quality was great. We left super full - but the long lag times to get cooked steak out on the full-service option was a bit disappointing. Next time, I might skip the full service and just get the self-service and cook my own meat over a Korean BBQ and take the wagyu they had at the buffet.\n\nNow - if you make it to the end and you still have room for dessert - you can try it. Their tiny dessert station didn’t have anything great in my opinion. We tried a few things and were underwhelmed. But hey - we were already bursting at the seams from all the Wagyu :)\n\nA must try!

That would probably be my only point of negative feedback. Quality was great. We left super full - but the long lag times to get cooked steak out on the full-service option was a bit disappointing.

Niku X is located in the Wilshire-Grand Building on the 2nd floor on the opposite side of the Intercontinenal Hotel. Found street parking on Figueroa & 6th. We took the escalators up and were about 20 minutes early, we were greeted by the hostess and led to the waiting area and given a drinks menu. Originally our reservation was for the $99 option but we decided to do the $139 instead (unfortunately we did not get to do the tomahawk that is part of the $139 option as we needed to preorder by 1:30 PM). We waited about 5 minutes and were led to our giant table with a grill in the center. Mikey introduced himself to us as our server and he was cool, friendly and very attentive along with the other staff.\n\nTo start off there is the self-serve buffet style salad bar (NIKU salad, mushrooms & zucchini for grilling, seafood salad, kimchi, fruit), then the crudo bar (wagyu tartare, bluefin tuna toro w/ scallion, salmon, A5 wagyu tartare, amberjack, halibut, scallop, ceviche), then the hot foods (white rice topped with furikake, wagyu curry, wagyu mapo tofu, fried veggies, shrimp tempura and then the meat locker (Japanese A5 chef's choice steak, Japanese A5 top sirloin, American Wagyu Ribeye, American Wagyu Striploin, American Wagyu Tenderloin) and then the chilled seafood (oysters, scallops, lobster tail, snow crab legs & king crab legs) and the condiments (lemon, cajun butter, pink peppercorn mignonette & yuzu cocktail sauce) and lastly a small dessert section.\n\nThere were items on the menu that you had to order through your server. We tried the potato pave, oxtail potstickers, A5 wagyu sando, miso Chilean sea bass, wagyu tallow shishito peppers, wagyu sukiyaki, and lamb lollipop. Because of the $139 option we were each allowed to order 1 item from the Chef's Special Seafood so we chose the ultimate sashimi platter (assorted sashimi, uni, foie gras, caviar) and sushi platter which was incredible. The quality of fish was very fresh, each piece of sushi was dabbed with a little sauce/tare and the slightly acidic vinegar rice was perfect and really opened up the appetite.\n\nThe meat what can I say? Every single piece melted in the mouth, after a slight sear on both sides of the beef and got great maillard reaction. You can season your meat with the condiments at the table  (salt, pepper, chili powder, wasabi salt, house blend, truffle salt). Our favorites were definitely the Japanese cuts, they were VERY rich and a little goes a long way but it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience throughout being able to enjoy small dishes of quality seafood from the crudo bar or some salad  in between the rich meat and most definitely the seafood... not many places offer king crab legs so this is legit, crab crackers and crab shears provided as well, the crab meat were both so naturally sweet with a bit of brininess from the salt water, id say the crab legs alone make it worth it, just go to Costco and take a look at the cooked red king crab legs. I didn't try any of the desserts or hot food items except for the wagyu fried rice and shrimp tempura but I'll definitely be back to enjoy the full experience, hopefully with an earlier reservation time.\n\nAlso, this is a restaurant part of the Chubby Group (Chubby Cattle, Chubby Curry, Wagyu House, Yumiyaki, Mikiya, Chubby Skewers) so make sure you get the app and points!

I took my girlfriend here as a part of a larger anniversary weekend and we both thoroughly enjoyed our experience. We both are already wanting to go back!\n\nWe did the tasting menu, which was coursed out over 2 hours or so. Additionally, we ordered some a la carte items and drinks (they now have their liquor license, which I had seen some recent reviews saying they didn't yet).\n\nFood:\n\nThe first course was sashimi, which was actually one of favorites. The fish was so fresh and it had some jelly on top, which added a next level of flavor to the dish. We then were served our a la carte items, which were the wagyu bone marrow and 1000 layer potato. The wagyu bone marrow is a must! The bread alone is worth it, but the bone marrow itself is the best I have had.\n\nThe caviar, uni, and wagyu dish seems excessive from the extent that it is so many luxury items together in one dish, though it is amazing. It genuinely tastes like something out of this world. The uni was so fresh and the caviar was the perfect balance of flavor and saltiness. Together with the side items that are served with the dish, it is complemented really well.\n\nThe wagyu tray of various cuts of meats is the star of the show, both according to visuals and taste. The cuts of meat are all cooked and served by the waitstaff, which are explained in detail. Each piece was somehow better than the last.\n\nthe final course of a5 wagyu on toast with blueberry jam and foie gras, was good, but I think ti could have been a little better. I think the flavors complemented each other very well, but knowing how a5 tastes by itself, it made me wanting more out of the dish a little. I wanted to taste the richness of the meat and I though that was lacking from the dish. The dish itself was great, but it felt like deep down I was missing something, since I know all of the ingredients separately.\n\nDrinks:\n\nThe Matcha Colada was great, especially if you like matcha. It was fresh matcha and definitely blended well with the coconut. I would recommend it for matcha lovers.\n\nThe margarita was probably one of the best margaritas that I have had ANYWHERE in LA. It was that good. Definitely a 10/10 for me.\n\nUme Raba was good, but my 3rd ranked from the bunch. It was refereshing, but not really my style.\n\nAs a bonus, they serve oolong tea as a palette cleanser mid-meal, which was great. I will unashamedly admit I had 4 cups of tea.\n\nDessert:\n\nMatcha dessert was super rich, but delicious. I liked it a lot. It was similar to a matcha ice cream, with powdered matcha around it. My girlfriend thought the matcha flavor was too rich, though I thought it was perfect.\n\nThe creme brûlée was the better of the two dishes as was the textbook definition of an ideal dessert in my opinion. Only only downside is that it is pretty small.\n\nService:\n\nService was tip tier, like you would find in a Michelin restaurant. The servers were knowledgeable and friendly, especially about the dishes and what they were preparing for us.\n\nOverall:\n\nThe food was all top tier and I have no doubt that this place will receive a Michelin Star in the near future. If someone asked me what I wanted to eat every day for the rest of my life, it would be this place. I would happily do so.\n\nI now dream to do the tomahawk experience next. Hopefully sometime soon.

Just picture perfect and indulgent at the same time. The food was wonderful, rich and again a well planned adventure. I LOVE that some of our humongous (and delicious) steak was used to prepare our fried rice later in the meal. Some of my favorite dishes were the salad, oxtail wontons, 16 layer potato stack and the Bone marrow. (That's like everything lol)\nOh and PLEASE slather your steak in the egg sauce ... AH-mazing!! (I poured a bit over my fried rice too)\nIf you are up for a foodie adventure, definitely visit Niku X.  Perfect for a special occasion as well!\nThere were other items I wanted to try on the menu but the portions on the tasting menu were perfectly filling.\nI Will definitely return sooner than later cause I had my eye on the Uni caviar dish!\n\nPlenty of self parking in the parking garage or just valet at the Hotel.

The staff were very friendly, cleaned our table promptly, and frequently checked if everything was okay. However, the food was a major letdown. It wasn’t terrible, but it was far from good. The meat was overly fatty (not same as wagyu that we had in Japan), and the crab was excessively salty, almost as if it was intentionally overseasoned to discourage eating too much.\nInitially, I thought $149 was reasonable for high-quality meat, crab, and lobster, but we ended up with portions that felt worth only about $30. Even as someone who doesn’t eat large portions, I couldn’t enjoy more than a few bites. I’m writing this review to save others time and money. You’re better off dining somewhere else with better quality food and portions that are satisfying, especially if you’re not a big eater.

                    "Context": "For a luxury restaurant, it's not just about the food but the whole dining experience. Here are the details:\nReservations for the Chubby insiders (Gold\nNFT), who has priority reservations privileges: me.\n1 star At reservation via Discord community concierge, it didn't require me to select tomahawk dinner or buffet dinner. I thought it is a decision at dine-in time. OpenTables reservation does request/require the decision (kudos!) This resulted in not getting the meal I made the restaurant reservation for. Mission unaccomplished! Zero (0) stars\nMade the reservation at 6:30pm but not at my requested time: 7:30pm. 1 star\nManagement review 2 stars\nThe manager came to explain that reservation is required to order the tomahawk meal and there must be an issue with the corporate priority reservation system. I commend the Manager's patience to explain that it takes 3 hours to prepare the tomahawk and so requires the reservation. I told him that I drove 500 miles to dine there and see if he can help find a solution. He was patient but can't offer any solutions. Sigh... He did ask if there is anything he can do to make my stay more pleasant, please let him know. Hmmm... although sincere, but no real solution and no hard offers. Hey, a $5 discount coupon or some concession of something can ease my displeasure of the establishment (whether it is corporate or the operator that made the mistake for my predicament of not getting the meal I intended to have). Another solution is to start cooking another tomahawk at 6:30pm for the 9:30 client and provide the spare for me.\nThey close at midnight. Hey, I'm not manager to offer solutions. I felt he could have done better.\nDecor (decoration) is nice but the environment feels like a flea market... as an upscale restaurant with $100-$250 meal tickets, something can be done to make it more comfy.\nMore comments if inquired.\n\nFeedback at Discord: zero stars\nI thought that I would provide this feedback internally to the company via their chat community. \"Aiyu Jelly\" handle name which is a trusted friend of the company responded by implying that i didn't read the menu. The fine print is embedded in the menu of 8x11 with a small print. Check it out. I'll bet you can't find it.\nThen, some of my comments similar to this here are censored (deleted) in the feedback section! I don't know if the same person or other company person did the censoring. Why ask for feedback when censoring? And I'm locked out for 24 hours in commenting. So, here I am.\nAs for the server Nate, excellent 5+ stars service. Patient in hearing my orders; gives great recommendations and offers different ways to enjoy my meal. Michelin Star service.\nThe company should give him bonuses!\nFood & drinks: 3 stars summary\nSince I didn't get my intended meal of sit down served meal of tomahawk plus seafood & appetizers. -2 stars\n\nFruity cocktail was offered & accepted. Excellent tastes with the lychee infused alcoholic drink.\n(3.0 stars.)\nMeat & seafood (3 stars)\nA5 steaks... filet, rib eye, ny steak all excellent quality ... 4 stars rounded down to 3 stars. And I have to cook it myself on the grill. Grill fire is quite high and not adjustable, so it's hard to cook it correctly (-1 star). Nate (server) suggested that I let the kitchen cook it. It's better but still not the best. For the buffet review: the cooked seafood quality was 3 stars ... limited in variety and bland. Lobster tail was cold & I had to put in the grill to heat it up (2 stars). Perhaps some sauce can be provided besides hot butter? The sashimi of tuna, hamachi & salmon are pretty good. (3.5 stars).\nSide dishes & appetizers & dessert & coffee shishito peppers very good with right sauce\n4 stars\nSeabass lettuce wrap... yummy but not can be tastier or wrapped better 3.5 stars\nOxtail pot stickers... meat inside is too dry.\nSauce was nice . 1 star\nMatcha cheesecake 1 star the other \"x\" cheesecake 3 stars\nEspresso $8 is too acidic... 1 star\nWagyu taco is tasty 3 stars\nShrimp uni taco 3 stars\nWagyu fried rice 3.5 stars Food: 3 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 2\n\nFood: 3\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 2"

I requested my wagyu to be medium rare and it came out over cooked like beef jerky. This definitely made me question if they’re using a cheap meat vendor for their steaks to make a profit. On this Monday at 7pm, they’ve already ran out of half of the cocktail menu which was disappointing. The service, was awful. Overall it wasn’t busy that night, but it felt like the bigger tables had priority for service as I noticed others with a table of two kept looking around for their waiter as well. I chose the $149 buffet option, and you’re still limited on the amount of meats you can receive but once again, I stuck with the seafood option because of how low of quality the meat tasted. I go to high end restaurants all the time. This place is not high end. But the atmosphere is nice.

The same applies to the entire seafood bar.\n\nRegarding the Japanese beef cuts, I have been to Japan over ten times and dined at no fewer than six reputable steak houses. Based on my experience, the beef served here was clearly frozen, and its quality was mediocre at best. While the restaurant claims to offer A5-grade meat, I find that highly unlikely. I have had A5 beef on numerous occasions, and while these cuts may indeed be Japanese, they do not meet the standards of true A5 quality.\n\nThe service was equally disappointing.

I thought From Chef would be special, so I ordered a few, but except for the lobster tail, there's nothing that's \"wow~ delicious\", and I'm so full that it's hard to eat anything else, so I don't recommend it. I think it felt even more greasy because there were no vegetables or refreshing flavors to go with the grill. I saw oysters and scrubs on YouTube, but they weren't there the day I went. The lobster was hard to eat because the shell didn't separate because they cooked it somehow. The king crab wasn't high quality, but it was all small and low quality and not very edible, so it was a bit disappointing. You have to call 24 hours in advance for dry-aged meat. The atmosphere is good, but the servers are busy and they bring it a bit late when you order. It's a bit disappointing because there's nothing worth eating for the price.

The upgrade to $149: the sushi platter wasn’t impressive, the crab legs platter was salty, the baked big shrimp had too much sauce. The tomahawk was too dry. The A5 wagyu wasn’t as buttery melt in your mouth that I expected. The only thing that I thought was good was the wagyu fried rice. Lastly, as we were leaving, three employees was at the check in and didn’t bother to say good bye or thank you. For the ambiance, quality and the price, I was really disappointed.

The reservation and the menu are misleading at best, downright scammy at worst.\n\nWelcome to bait and switch at its finest.\n\nFirst of all, nowhere in the reservation process tells you that if you reserve $139/$149, you will NOT have a grill. So that's the biggest surprise. When asked, the server was trained to ask back, \"Did you reserve a grill?\" Knowing in the reservation process, there was no indication of reserving a grill or table service. You would think that important detail should be indicated.\nNot sure why their reservation system was set up this way, regardless if it's the poor planning and designing or if it's intentionally done, we felt tricked.\n\nSecond, the menu you see on their official website is a joke. You'd think the menu online is updated and is what you'll get and is what you used to decide if you'll dine here, Surprise! Most of the items we wanted are not on the \"restaurant menu\". For example, Oysters, grilled or raw, were nowhere to be found, and there were absolutely no scallops. The ultimate sashimi platter disappeared from the menu as well. And guess what, all the waygu meats that you see on the menu and it's at the buffet station that you thought was unlimited? Yeah, NOPE, you can't grab them because you ain't got a grill 😂. Jokes on you. You have to order them, and they take 30+ minutes to arrive at your table cold with no flavor. Just imagine undercooked fatty meat cold and bland in your mouth. 🤮\n\nFinally, the food. Like I mentioned, the sliced waygu meats were gross. They were undercooked, cold, and tasteless. The Tomahawk Steak was good. It needed more black pepper and salt but was cooked perfectly. Handful selections of raw food at the buffet station were good. It's probably the only thing I enjoyed. Lobster tails were ok, but the crab legs sucked. The small dishes \"from chef\" sucked real bad. The dessert was disgusting.\n\nNO, it's definitely not worth the price.\n\nI wondered how I got this experience when I thought I did my research... so I skimmed through the reviews and realized almost all good reviews are made by accounts that have a total of 1 review 🤔. 🙄 Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 1 Service: 2 Atmosphere: 2\n\nService: Dine in\nMeal type: Dinner\nPrice per person: $100+\nFood: 1\nService: 2\nAtmosphere: 2"

If you want to order drinks, remember, they are extra, and the staff won't tell you! The only difference between the 99 and 139 yuan buffets is that you can only order one of four dishes per person, and each serving only contains two pieces of food.

Only American wagyu options were available in the fridge, no Japanese wagyu AT ALL. Crudo station was empty with exception of a few small dishes being set out occasionally that would go quickly. NO KING CRAB was ever available on any of our visits to the buffet line.\n\nWhile eating, my wife bit into a small plastic bead pictured below which appears to be a hair bead that was somehow fallen into the food she ate. Absolutely disgusting!!!\n\nAs for the service, it was also atrocious!! Once we were sat, we ordered waters for the table and a kids cup for my son. My wife and I received our water but our son’s never came so we asked again. Wait 20min, still no water so we ask again. We wait again no one comes to the table to check on us or asks if we need anything until 20min later when a bus boy comes around and asks and we finally got the water for my son 40minutes after we got ours. After this, I walked to the host stand to speak to the manager about how we were upset about the food/water situation and was told that a manager would be sent over but guess what? No manager ever showed. We then asked for our check through the bus boy and waited roughly 15min before asking again because no one ever brought it. A manager was finally brought our check and we made him aware of the situation. Manager was very apologetic and offered to comp one of our meals.\n\nI would never visit this establishment again nor would I ever recommend it.\n\nSTAY AWAY AND EAT ELSEWHERE!!!!!

We assumed it would be a 10-15 minute wait but 30 minutes had already passed before any type of update. We spoke to one of the front managers and he had apologized for the wait but did not have an estimated time for the next available table. He offered us the regular menu to order some appetizers while we were still waiting in the lobby, so we had placed an order for 2 Japanese Albacore with Crispy Onion handrolls to tide over our appetite. We were waiting roughly for 10-15 minutes for our order, but thankfully we were called for an open table.\n\nWe were finally seated at 8:15pm and immediately placed our food order for the DineLA menu. We received our first order of the crudo along with our order of the 2 albacore handrolls at 8:22pm. We quickly devoured those 2 items after waiting an hour to be seated. We were waiting on our next course but we did not receive it until 8:49pm. We received our Dashi Yukke Soup at a warm but not hot temperature and 27 minutes after our first course.\n\nAt this point, we were extremely hungry and disappointed in the level of execution and service at the restaurant. To wait nearly 30 minutes in between each course was completely absurd. If we continued with the same pace, our dinner would last 2 hours and we would end our dinner at 10pm. We spoke with the manager and he apologized for the wait and offered to ask the chef if they could expedite the rest of our menu. We then got the rest of the menu (Chimichurri Bone Marrow and A5 Wagyu Yakiniku) 10 minutes later. We also received the Fried Brussel Sprouts on the house.\n\nTo conclude dinner, they also sent over 2 desserts. We appreciated that they were able to comp the handrolls, brussel sprouts, and desserts for all the inconvenience. Once we received the check, the manager came over again to apologize for the wait and offered us a 15% service discount. We left the restaurant after paying.\n\nI started feeling some stomach pains once we left the restaurant. I confided with my friend who I had ate with and she had also had slight stomach pains. On my drive home, I started to feel nauseous and knew it was definitely from something I had eaten. My friend later confided in me that she started feeling the same way around 4am. We felt horrible and found out that we both got food poisoning. We both concluded that it must have been something we had both eaten at the restaurant since we both had similar symptoms. We are both extremely disappointed in the whole experience given that Niku X holds such a high standard for food and experience.

Location is great and so is the decor.\n2.) We were seated promptly (a Thursday).  Party of 6 but they don't really have any rectangular tables so we sat in 1 square and 1 circular table so we could all fit.  That was odd and annoying.\n3.)  Service is slow.   The place was not busy but the server would disappear for awhile.  I know it's a buffet but restaurants make $$ on drinks moreso than anything else.\n4.) The drinks were....meh.   I was looking for a fancy old fashion or mule.  Instead the drink menu had 6 or 7 l drinks and it seemed all pre-made and some slushy style with alcohol.  (Felt cheap) Not a fancy menu at all for the top dollar being spent.  The wine was good but came in a bottle (lol)\n5.) Seafood options - Lobster, Tiger/large shrimp, sushi.  These options were good - however - I would go elsewhere and eat that as a separate meal.\n6.) The Tomahawk was ok.   We ordered 1 per couple.  It was too much because that should've been a separate meal as well.  Instead of eating buffet/unlimited seafood and a big tomahawk.   It would've been better to eat twice there at a more modest price.  (That was our bad)\n7.) The Tomahawk \"show\" to wow us.  Meh... maybe because I got older and it was a repeat of a past experience.  We had 3 Tomahawks and got 1 show.   We had to share the first Tomahawk because they didn't bring us the other 2 until 30 mins later.   Again restaurant was not busy at all.\n8.) The bill.  The bill came and certain items that were comped because of the birthday were not.  They were charged. Also, when they fixed it they taxed us on the FULL amount vs the subtotal.  Their excuse was that the item was \"prepared\" so it's still taxable.  Lastly on the bill.  The tip was automatically included on again the full amount including the items comped.   So where they comped???  It all was corrected after their frustration.  Table was full of numbers people so.....yeah.  Saved $30 per person...worth it.\n\nOverall, the spot is nice and the food ok for the price point and experience.\n\nGo once and say you went.\n\nIf you go don't do the Tomahawk.  Get at the A5 if you can and balance that with the seafood.\n\nSome folks question the legitimacy of the wagyu quality.   I'm not a connoisseur but will say that I'll stick to my ribeye and the smaller cuts of Wagyu. Food: 3 Service: 2 Atmosphere: 4\n\nFood: 3\nService: 2\nAtmosphere: 4"

It felt like we were lucky just to get our waiter’s attention during the entire meal.

Melt in your mouth doesn't do it justice.  I expected to focus on the lobster tail but to be honest, I was a little disappointed in them. I tried 3 different tails and none of them were easy to remove from the shell even though they were all cut down the back. The flavor was good however and they were nice sized. The star of the night was by far the Chilean Sea Bass!!! Do not skip it! We paid $119 each plus $16 for valet parking (loved that option) and we considered it completely worth every penny.

Crabs and lobsters are overcooked like you won't believe. Literally felt like biting my own finger when biting on the big head shrimp. However they don't gate keep their good stuff. All the seafood and waygu are at the buffet station. Love the no fuss buffet.\n\nBuffet station is small and make-shift from a bar/hallway. some of the beef and most of the \"filler\" type side dishes has to be ordered from the servers. It is confusing what needs to be ordered what's not, so we ended up didn't order much but just focused on the seafood and waygu at the buffet, which is good for us bad for their business lol. Types of sushi selection comes and goes at the buffet which is odd.\n\nGuest has no dress code. We dressed up but saw flipflops lol.

Very knowledgeable about the menu, both food and drinks and continued to help us pick great options. Daniel (I believe Im remembering his name right) at the host stand was also really nice and very accommodating when our table was taking longer to be ready than our reservation time.\n\nWe got the premium menu (priced at $159 pp; recently increased and not properly reflected on their whole website and certain physical menus) which included the seafood buffet and all of the steak cuts.  The steaks were all delicious, from the domestic Wagyu to the delicious JP A5, and the self serve seafood buffet was full enough that everyone could find something to enjoy. They also had restock times for some of the more popular items as well as utensils like seafood scissors and crab crackers which were necessities.\n\nI’d definitely take some time to consider what you’re going to want to get and when—like getting a buffet plate and enjoying what you got first before ordering some steak—so you don’t let certain foods get cold or cross flavors you may not have intended to, which was a slight issue I had figured may (and did) happen, but that didn’t take away from the food quality.\n\nGreat overall experience from the whole staff. I’d go again simply to enjoy the experience differently, maybe at one of the KBBQ style table grills or just ordering my dinner differently, but if you’re thinking about giving it a go and/or concerned about the price point, I’d say it’s worth your while at least once to see and judge for yourself !

When we sat down, we immediately ordered Japanese A5 ribeye and tenderloin.\n\nWhat we liked:\n- Japanese A5 steaks - sliced thin, good quality, not a lot in each serving but because of the heavy fat content it fills you up quickly!\n- Wagyu fried rice - whoever is working the wok on the rice is doing a great job!\n- Unlimited lobster tails and king crab legs at the buffet - served chilled on ice, but supplied with lemons and butter and very fresh. And they’ve cut the lobster tails in half to make it even easier to eat.\n- Miso Sea bass - served in “cubes” that were pan fried and served on a skewer.

Good selection.\n\nCocktails / wine - expansive menu - prices are about what you would expect for LA prices.\n\nService - Wissal was our server - very friendly - informative and professional. Thanks for a great time! In terms of the food service, honestly it was a bit slow. I know you get 2 hours to eat but we often sat 15-20 minutes with no steak despite ordering. That would probably be my only point of negative feedback. Quality was great. We left super full - but the long lag times to get cooked steak out on the full-service option was a bit disappointing. Next time, I might skip the full service and just get the self-service and cook my own meat over a Korean BBQ and take the wagyu they had at the buffet.\n\nNow - if you make it to the end and you still have room for dessert - you can try it. Their tiny dessert station didn’t have anything great in my opinion. We tried a few things and were underwhelmed. But hey - we were already bursting at the seams from all the Wagyu :)\n\nA must try!

Niku X is located in the Wilshire-Grand Building on the 2nd floor on the opposite side of the Intercontinenal Hotel. Found street parking on Figueroa & 6th. We took the escalators up and were about 20 minutes early, we were greeted by the hostess and led to the waiting area and given a drinks menu. Originally our reservation was for the $99 option but we decided to do the $139 instead (unfortunately we did not get to do the tomahawk that is part of the $139 option as we needed to preorder by 1:30 PM). We waited about 5 minutes and were led to our giant table with a grill in the center. Mikey introduced himself to us as our server and he was cool, friendly and very attentive along with the other staff.\n\nTo start off there is the self-serve buffet style salad bar (NIKU salad, mushrooms & zucchini for grilling, seafood salad, kimchi, fruit), then the crudo bar (wagyu tartare, bluefin tuna toro w/ scallion, salmon, A5 wagyu tartare, amberjack, halibut, scallop, ceviche), then the hot foods (white rice topped with furikake, wagyu curry, wagyu mapo tofu, fried veggies, shrimp tempura and then the meat locker (Japanese A5 chef's choice steak, Japanese A5 top sirloin, American Wagyu Ribeye, American Wagyu Striploin, American Wagyu Tenderloin) and then the chilled seafood (oysters, scallops, lobster tail, snow crab legs & king crab legs) and the condiments (lemon, cajun butter, pink peppercorn mignonette & yuzu cocktail sauce) and lastly a small dessert section.\n\nThere were items on the menu that you had to order through your server. We tried the potato pave, oxtail potstickers, A5 wagyu sando, miso Chilean sea bass, wagyu tallow shishito peppers, wagyu sukiyaki, and lamb lollipop. Because of the $139 option we were each allowed to order 1 item from the Chef's Special Seafood so we chose the ultimate sashimi platter (assorted sashimi, uni, foie gras, caviar) and sushi platter which was incredible. The quality of fish was very fresh, each piece of sushi was dabbed with a little sauce/tare and the slightly acidic vinegar rice was perfect and really opened up the appetite.\n\nThe meat what can I say? Every single piece melted in the mouth, after a slight sear on both sides of the beef and got great maillard reaction. You can season your meat with the condiments at the table  (salt, pepper, chili powder, wasabi salt, house blend, truffle salt). Our favorites were definitely the Japanese cuts, they were VERY rich and a little goes a long way but it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience throughout being able to enjoy small dishes of quality seafood from the crudo bar or some salad  in between the rich meat and most definitely the seafood... not many places offer king crab legs so this is legit, crab crackers and crab shears provided as well, the crab meat were both so naturally sweet with a bit of brininess from the salt water, id say the crab legs alone make it worth it, just go to Costco and take a look at the cooked red king crab legs. I didn't try any of the desserts or hot food items except for the wagyu fried rice and shrimp tempura but I'll definitely be back to enjoy the full experience, hopefully with an earlier reservation time.\n\nAlso, this is a restaurant part of the Chubby Group (Chubby Cattle, Chubby Curry, Wagyu House, Yumiyaki, Mikiya, Chubby Skewers) so make sure you get the app and points!

Our server was very friendly, which I love in a course meal, being able to chat with them during the experience. The only downside of the space is that the restaurant was playing upbeat music which was loud. It was a bit bothersome and was hard to hear the servers explaining each course.\nOnto the food, I highly recommend the course meals because these are experiences designed from beginning to last and they give you a full experience. I chose the lower priced menu because the starters felt more appealing, and they definitely hit the spot. All the dishes throughout the night are very rich, overflowing with umami flavors from ingredients like truffle, Wagyu, and egg yolk. At the same time, the chefs at Niku X know to pair these fatty beef cuts with acidic garnishes like lemon and ume, which helps balance out the intensity. I can nitpick a few things, but that is after understanding that the whole meal was amazing. With the tenderloin, they present it on a small, soft slice of bread and this portion was hard to eat without it all falling apart. The sukiyaki had a whole shiso leaf with it to eat, and that was overbearing over the rest of the ingredients.\nIf you are looking for a premium dinner experience, definitely look to Niku X to be pampered with an incredibly enjoyable night.

We made a reservation a week in advance and were seated promptly by the window with a great view.\n\nWe ordered only from the A La Carte menu because we wanted to have more control over our dining experience.\n\nStarted off with the Oxtail & Wagyu Potstickers and the Wagyu Tartare. The potstickers were tasty and had a lot of savory/umami/citrus notes. The tartare was a completely new experience for both of us as we'd never eaten raw beef before. It was seasoned really well and the texture wasn't off putting. Quail egg was a great touch.\n\nNext we were served our choices of meat: Masami Outside Skirt Wagyu, Miyazaki Tri Tip, and Stone Axe Short Rib. The wagyu was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and a favorite for both of us. The other two cuts were slightly more tough to chew, but sooo flavorful and buttery. The server gave us pairing recommendations for the condiments & meat.\n\nThe star of the show was truly the Dry Aged Masami Strip Loin. We got an 8 oz. portion instead of 6 oz. due to our order being put in incorrectly. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare!\n\nFinally ended our dinner with the Wagyu Fried Rice. This was tasty and had flavor components that a traditional fried rice wouldn't have. Lots of citrus notes and the egg presentation was beautiful. The wagyu bits were cut up so tiny though, it made me forget there was wagyu in the dish at all.\n\nLastly, they treated us to two complimentary desserts! We got the matcha pillow and the crème brûlée. The matcha pillow is just matcha ice cream, but I could tell the matcha quality was very good. The crème brûlée wasn't anything special but it was good!\n\nI'm subtracting 1-star because I do think they're still getting into the swing of things, as they haven't officially had a grand opening yet. For first timers, I think there could have been a bit more assistance with explaining the menu beforehand - we had to ask the waiter for recommendations! The format of the meat grilling felt a little awkward at times because the server was just standing there watching us eat. And as I mentioned earlier, there was a misunderstanding with the order, so the strip loin and fried rice weren't put in until we asked about it later. We fortunately didn't have to pay for parking because we didn't drive, but I do think the $16.50 fee for parking valet is a bit ridiculous for how much you're paying to eat. Overall though this made for a perfect date night and our waiter Meng was fantastic! I really appreciated when he brought out the strip loin and he told us to start video recording because the steak reveal was so grand!

The way the staff moved around and made things happen felt so \"top secret\" and movie-like.. I absolutely loved the vibe.\nThe food was literally works of art presented on platters. Just picture perfect and indulgent at the same time. The food was wonderful, rich and again a well planned adventure. I LOVE that some of our humongous (and delicious) steak was used to prepare our fried rice later in the meal. Some of my favorite dishes were the salad, oxtail wontons, 16 layer potato stack and the Bone marrow. (That's like everything lol)\nOh and PLEASE slather your steak in the egg sauce ... AH-mazing!! (I poured a bit over my fried rice too)\nIf you are up for a foodie adventure, definitely visit Niku X.  Perfect for a special occasion as well!\nThere were other items I wanted to try on the menu but the portions on the tasting menu were perfectly filling.\nI Will definitely return sooner than later cause I had my eye on the Uni caviar dish!\n\nPlenty of self parking in the parking garage or just valet at the Hotel.

On multiple occasions, I had to get up from the table because our server was nowhere to be found. We repeatedly asked for the table to be cleared, yet it remained cluttered throughout the meal. To make matters worse, the desserts were brought out while the table was still in the same state, as shown in the attached photo—further reflecting the lack of attention to service.\n\nI chose the highest-tier buffet option, which is advertised as including premium Japanese beef cuts. However, the seafood selection was extremely underwhelming. The so-called King Crab was completely tasteless and appeared to have been frozen for a long time. As shown in the photos, the crab legs were unusually thin and lacked any substantial meat, making it clear that they had been stored frozen for an extended period. The same applies to the entire seafood bar.\n\nRegarding the Japanese beef cuts, I have been to Japan over ten times and dined at no fewer than six reputable steak houses. Based on my experience, the beef served here was clearly frozen, and its quality was mediocre at best. While the restaurant claims to offer A5-grade meat, I find that highly unlikely. I have had A5 beef on numerous occasions, and while these cuts may indeed be Japanese, they do not meet the standards of true A5 quality.\n\nThe service was equally disappointing. Beyond the lack of attentiveness, the dessert—a simple Häagen-Dazs ice cream—was served in its original packaging with plastic spoons, showing a complete disregard for presentation. This level of service and quality might be acceptable at a $30-per-person establishment, but certainly not at a restaurant charging over $150 per person.\n\nI hope this review helps others make an informed decision and avoid an experience that falls far short of expectations.

The reservation and the menu are misleading at best, downright scammy at worst.\n\nWelcome to bait and switch at its finest.\n\nFirst of all, nowhere in the reservation process tells you that if you reserve $139/$149, you will NOT have a grill. So that's the biggest surprise. When asked, the server was trained to ask back, \"Did you reserve a grill?\" Knowing in the reservation process, there was no indication of reserving a grill or table service. You would think that important detail should be indicated.\nNot sure why their reservation system was set up this way, regardless if it's the poor planning and designing or if it's intentionally done, we felt tricked.\n\nSecond, the menu you see on their official website is a joke. You'd think the menu online is updated and is what you'll get and is what you used to decide if you'll dine here, Surprise! Most of the items we wanted are not on the \"restaurant menu\". For example, Oysters, grilled or raw, were nowhere to be found, and there were absolutely no scallops. The ultimate sashimi platter disappeared from the menu as well. And guess what, all the waygu meats that you see on the menu and it's at the buffet station that you thought was unlimited? Yeah, NOPE, you can't grab them because you ain't got a grill 😂. Jokes on you. You have to order them, and they take 30+ minutes to arrive at your table cold with no flavor. Just imagine undercooked fatty meat cold and bland in your mouth. 🤮\n\nFinally, the food. Like I mentioned, the sliced waygu meats were gross. They were undercooked, cold, and tasteless. The Tomahawk Steak was good. It needed more black pepper and salt but was cooked perfectly. Handful selections of raw food at the buffet station were good. It's probably the only thing I enjoyed. Lobster tails were ok, but the crab legs sucked. The small dishes \"from chef\" sucked real bad. The dessert was disgusting.\n\nNO, it's definitely not worth the price.\n\nI wondered how I got this experience when I thought I did my research... so I skimmed through the reviews and realized almost all good reviews are made by accounts that have a total of 1 review 🤔. 🙄 Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 1 Service: 2 Atmosphere: 2\n\nService: Dine in\nMeal type: Dinner\nPrice per person: $100+\nFood: 1\nService: 2\nAtmosphere: 2"

Despite arriving early, we weren’t seated until 9 PM, which was frustrating and set the tone for the evening.\n\nOnce seated, things only got worse. The grill at our table was broken, and we were told there was no other table available to accommodate us. Since we paid for the full-service option, we weren’t even allowed to grill our own meat, which we would have preferred given the circumstances.\n\nThe service was painfully slow. It took over an hour for the first round of our limited 15 items to arrive, leaving us with little time to enjoy the meal within the 2-hour limit. The presentation of the meat was subpar—cuts were not well-prepared or what you'd expect from a high-end restaurant.\n\nThe most disappointing part was the quality of the food. The A5 wagyu beef from our second order was chewy and lacked the signature tenderness you’d expect from wagyu. It was so poor that we questioned whether it was even wagyu at all.\n\nWhile some staff members were polite, the overall experience was not worth the $1,500 we paid. Waiting for food, dealing with a broken grill, and being unable to enjoy the meal as promised made for a truly disappointing evening. We won’t be returning and can’t recommend this restaurant.

This restaurant  most definitely underdelivered for the $139 that they were charging. As a family, we eat fresh seafood regularly. So, we know what freshness tastes like. Perhaps it was the Thanksgiving long weekend and their suppliers had hard time delivering fresh seafood, or perhaps the restaurant's latest delivery was the day before Thanksgiving, when we visited the restaurant on Saturday, the seafood simply tasted unfresh. Many fish dishes had a mushy/slimy texture to them, and the shrimps/lobsters tasted unusually plain. The A5 Wagyu beef was tender, but they were all served on a large cold plate. By the time they were delivered to our table, the Wagyu pieces were all lukewarm. And eating beef with high fat content at a lukewarm temperature was definitely not an enjoyment, and even the Wagyu fried rice was lukewarm when served. The manager did come out and apologize, which was a nice gesture. I might try this restaurant again in the future, but will definitely avoid long weekend at all cost. BTW, I tried to scan the receipt using their Chubby app to accumulate points in the parking garage, but the app said it could only scan while we were physically inside the restaurant.

Those other restaurants are cheaper and judging by how they serve sushi and Japanese Wagyu also, it's better to get those dishes there than pay a butt load for this place.\n\nWe got the upgraded option of $139, and opted out to order any large steaks that you pre- order (ex. tomahawks range from 35-40 oz, and some other options that you can select of your choosing.\n\nService: Extremely horrendous. I had runners/staff members not even know the simple aspect of having certain condiments at their restaurant. One runner said they didn't have tabasco, but had chili oil; only for a FOH manager to come by and say they have no tabasco and chili oil. Our server kept getting our orders wrong which caused a delay in our meat being served because we were sat at a non-grill table. Our server admitted to getting the orders wrong completely. Wait was over 15-20 minutes long in between waiting for the next round. Runners/servers also kept serving dishes on the side of the table even if there was room in the middle of the table. Dishes were not cleaned up. I had almost 4 plates stacked just from appetizers because I was starving between rounds of meat never coming essentially.\n\nAmbiance: The restaurant is nice, but with the amount of complaining tables surrounding our area, I definitely didn't think that I was at a high end semi fancy restaurant at all. Interior is dark and nice, but the buffet line could use some work as it is a narrow walkway and some patrons decide to stand and block the way as well.\n\nFood: Subpar at best. If I wanted to get expensive cut meat and be paying for 139 for it, I should be getting top quality. It was lukewarm at minimum every time we received the meat. It wasn't cooked to our medium rare liking, and some of the meats weren't the ones we ordered since our server got out order wrong multiple times.\n\nManager Education: Its pretty comical when even the managers of this establishment aren't well trained, couldn't answer simple questions of why the wait was taking so long, why the service was horrible, and why the raw seafood bar was completely barren for a great portion of the time. When we asked these questions, they completely invalidated our party and didn't try to resolve the solution or provide alternatives in any way possible. Pretty disappointing for a restaurant group that I've had pretty adequate experiences at their other sister restaurants.\n\nOverall, I am not stepping into this establishment again. This wasn't even half of the entire experience. I saw an influencer table get up and not touch their food or pay at all, and then another couple order the tomahawk and have a few bites and left, and then the table that got seated after they left also got up and complained why the food was delayed and the service was pretty unbearable. I advise eating at their sister restaurants for much cheaper like chubby cattle, yumiyaki, or even mikiya. At least you'll pay for the service you're getting and the quality of food. One of the worst experiences ever and to top it off, I sent an email to their feedback group and they promised they would get back in 48 hours, and they never got back to me :(. Save your money, and your wrinkles on this place.

They gave us a tiny table, and after we finished eating, no one came to clear our plates; we had to call them multiple times before they came. If you want to order drinks, remember, they are extra, and the staff won't tell you! The only difference between the 99 and 139 yuan buffets is that you can only order one of four dishes per person, and each serving only contains two pieces of food. Almost all the seafood was very stale; the only decent thing was the cake. We had to find a server three times and waited over ten minutes to pay the bill. A truly awful experience!

First off, much of the food was served cold and lacked flavor. The dipping sauces were sparse, and the tomahawk steak, which we expected to be a showstopper, was not only small for a table of six but also had burnt ends.\n\nThe crab legs were served cold as well, and the garlic butter tasted like it had no garlic in it at all. Even the hot meats were completely unseasoned, which was a huge letdown. This is far from what I’d expect from a restaurant claiming Michelin star-level quality.\n\nAnother issue was the table itself—it was far too small for the number of people and dishes. Plates and cups were constantly bumping into each other, which made the meal feel cramped and uncomfortable. For a fine dining experience, you’d think the space would be better suited for the number of dishes they serve.\n\nOn the positive side, our waitress Wissal was wonderful, and her service was top-notch. No complaints there. However, I was annoyed to find that we were charged for water without being informed in advance. I don’t mind paying, but a heads-up would’ve been nice.\n\nThe drinks were strong, but at the price point they charge, you'd expect nothing less. In the end, Niku X did not live up to the Michelin star standards they claim to meet. For the cost, the experience left a lot to be desired.\n\n-Cesar Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 1 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 2\n\nService: Dine in\nMeal type: Dinner\nPrice per person: $100+\nFood: 1\nService: 4\nAtmosphere: 2"

RUN, DON’T WALK!!\n\nWe visited on 8/31 for the AYCE tasting menu for $99 and it was a big disappointment in all aspects.\n\nTo start off we had a reservation on OpenTable for 7:30PM and we arrived at 7:25PM only to wait an additional hour until we were sat.\n\nThe AYCE selection was mostly absent, the walk up bar for food was empty most of the night. Only American wagyu options were available in the fridge, no Japanese wagyu AT ALL. Crudo station was empty with exception of a few small dishes being set out occasionally that would go quickly. NO KING CRAB was ever available on any of our visits to the buffet line.\n\nWhile eating, my wife bit into a small plastic bead pictured below which appears to be a hair bead that was somehow fallen into the food she ate. Absolutely disgusting!!!\n\nAs for the service, it was also atrocious!! Once we were sat, we ordered waters for the table and a kids cup for my son. My wife and I received our water but our son’s never came so we asked again. Wait 20min, still no water so we ask again. We wait again no one comes to the table to check on us or asks if we need anything until 20min later when a bus boy comes around and asks and we finally got the water for my son 40minutes after we got ours. After this, I walked to the host stand to speak to the manager about how we were upset about the food/water situation and was told that a manager would be sent over but guess what? No manager ever showed. We then asked for our check through the bus boy and waited roughly 15min before asking again because no one ever brought it. A manager was finally brought our check and we made him aware of the situation. Manager was very apologetic and offered to comp one of our meals.\n\nI would never visit this establishment again nor would I ever recommend it.\n\nSTAY AWAY AND EAT ELSEWHERE!!!!!

The steaks also took time to replenish. Very disappointed that they also ran out of the A5 wagyu which is one of the main reasons people go to this place. From the hot menu, the lamb chop and katsu sandwich (which is what most people talk about online) were also sold out!\n\nThe service left much to be desired as well as our drinks took forever to arrive and when we asked for another round of iced tea — they ran out (how does this happen?).\n\nWill probably not go back after this experience.

Despite their last call being at 10 PM, we arrived at 9:50 PM and were promptly informed that food orders needed to be placed before 10 PM. We quickly placed our order at 9:55 PM.\n\nHowever, when we ordered our drinks, the bartender's attitude was less than welcoming. My partner, who is allergic to alcohol, ordered a non-alcoholic drink, while I ordered an alcoholic one. The bartender clearly did not want to make our drinks as they were preparing to close.\n\nWhen our drinks were served, my partner's non-alcoholic drink contained alcohol. This could have been disastrous if we hadn't realized in time, especially considering my partner's allergy. Fortunately, we lived upstairs, but had she been the designated driver, this mistake could have put us in a very difficult situation.\n\nAfter waiting for half an hour, the manager approached us to inform us that due to a miscommunication, the kitchen was unable to prepare our food. He offered to pay for our drinks and said he would see what leftovers were available in the kitchen to serve us. Offering leftovers after making us wait for half an hour is simply unacceptable. We were extremely hungry after being out all day, and they could have informed us much sooner so we could have found somewhere else to eat.\n\nOverall, this experience was incredibly disappointing and potentially dangerous due to the mix-up with the drinks. We hope the management addresses these serious issues to prevent future incidents.

He tried to laugh off by saying “ahahahahh,… oh my gosh~~ I’m so sorryyyy~.” Then he walked away. It’s a lawsuit.

It was honestly a weird experience since the menu itself is actually pretty standard in size, but the presentation and idea to get up to grab the food from the serving area was awkward.\n\nYou would have to wait for a refresh of new food to grab, and given that the restaurant had a decent size, felt somewhat awkward when there wasn't any food left, or very few left to grab.\n\nSome of the appetizers were pretty good, but others were really surprisingly lackluster. The ceviche that is always offered has a very bland flavor, it felt like it was missing some core flavor profiles.\n\nFor the price of $100+ before tax and tip, I honestly felt like I could've went anywhere else for this price and had a more positive memorable meal.

While the restaurant definitely looks upscale and visually impressive, the experience unfortunately didn’t live up to expectations.\n\nService was a major letdown. It felt like we were lucky just to get our waiter’s attention during the entire meal. For a place that presents itself as fine dining, the level of attention and hospitality was severely lacking.\n\nAs for the food, the meats were just okay—nothing special or memorable. The buffet selection was very limited, especially considering the high price point. What’s worse is that the lunch menu doesn’t offer the variety or quality you’d expect compared to dinner, yet it’s still expensive.\n\nFor what we paid, I expected top-tier meats and exceptional service. Instead, we left feeling disappointed and like the whole experience was overpriced for what little was offered. I wouldn’t recommend coming here for lunch, especially if you’re expecting the kind of selection and service that should come with a premium price tag.

We had the $159/person menu Without Grill on table  although the menu we got as well as the web clearly says $149/person( kind of misleading). First round we tried the JP A5 Ribeyes and Striploin which both melts in your mouth with an aroma that is indeed A grade JP Wagyu beef. We also grab some crab legs from the station and crab meat is warm and fresh. Everything seems to be good for the first 30 minutes and then things went south. It took them 30 minutes to get the 2nd round of the Wagyu steak from the kitchen AFTER we complained to the waiter for wait 20 minutes for nothing. Although the waiter and the manager did manage to get the steak speed up later on, even offering free drinks, we ended up with lots of Wagyu steaks on the table at the same time and it soon became too overwhelming while eating too much oily steak for such a short period of time. Till the end, we realized that we never even get the lobster tail we ordered earlier while they will never forget your appetizers. As for the dessert, they have a limited selection of cake flavors. Make sure you order the ones you like in between the dining otherwise you might not be able to get the flavor you want at the end. Overall, crab labs are good, shrimp is okay,  sashimi is average but at least they all taste fresh. A5 Wagyu only the Premium 5 oz Wagyu Worth the try but not the special Wagyu cut. If you like seafood, just go with the basic menu option. If you want Wagyu, make sure you reserve the table WITH GRILL or you will get GRILLED.

The joint is basically just a bougie buffet.\n\nThe place has ambiance. Decor and staff make you feel like it's an elevated dining experience. But I came here to stuff my face for 2 hours, not admire the lighting.\n\nTo make it simple, I'll just rate what I ate as a list. I don't feel like typing paragraphs of pulp. We both got better things to do.\n\nAll the A5 wagyu:\nWow, melt in your mouth beefy goodness. After this, anything leaner will just be leather. Make sure you don't grill it too long. Rare to medium is the way to go for this stuff.\n\nAll the other beef:\nIt's okay. But bad. If you want to try it, do it before the A5.\n\nBeef tataki:\nYummy. Had three rounds of it. But that's if you like rare/raw beef. The sauce/marinade is what made it delicious. Refreshing, but I'm sure a more accurate descriptor could be used.\n\nLobster:\nNot bad, but kind of boring in it's own. Luckily they have plenty of things to dip it in. If you don't like it cold, throw it in the grill for a few minutes.\n\nKing crab:\nHuge disappointment. SO SALTY. I know they do this so you don't eat a mountain of it, but this is a bit extreme. The first round of four pieces is all we ate. It's as salty as the typical snow crab at your local cheap Chinese buffet. NIKUX, I guess you've accomplished your mission since we ate only one round.\n\nSnow crab:\nDidn't touch after eating the king crab. I would be flabbergasted if it was actually less salty. But I doubt it.\n\nSelection of raw fish:\nTuna is okay. Yellowtail could be better. Didn't try the poke though.\n\nOysters:\nWow, you gotta love oysters to consume these. So fishy and \"oyster\" tasting. Yeah, yeah, I'm an oyster amateur. Or maybe it's old?\n\nScallops:\nFresh and sweet. Complete opposite to the oysters. Not fishy at all.\n\nThere are many items you order through server and they bring from the kitchen. Didn't get to try all of them, but the sea bass was tasty. The sando was yummy also, but you don't want to fill up of that stuff. Didn't do any of the rice dishes since it wasn't cooked with enough water when we ate the yakisuki at the beginning of the meal.\n\nDesserts:\nWhatever. The chocolate mousse thingy was the best out of the selection.\n\nOne thing that I really didn't like is that when you're done with dinner and you've paid your bill, the server will ask you to leave them a review by scanning a QR code. But the server will click on the options in your phone to give themselves a review and submit it before you even know what's going on. A bit shady.\n\nIs it worth $99? Yes, because of the real A5 and the lobster. But other than that, nothing there makes want to go back and have it again. Been there, done that, move on.
