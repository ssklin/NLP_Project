If you’re not afraid of heat and want to see what’s trending in Asia’s street food scene, this is the spot.\nYou’ll often see groups of young girls ordering tons of meat and laughing over steaming bowls of malatang — it’s such a fun vibe. The food is priced by weight ($14.99/lb), and they even deduct the bowl’s weight before weighing, which makes it super fair. The soup base is free, and the staff are friendly and efficient.\nFor reference, if you cook at home, slices of meat usually costs around $4–8/lb, so the price here is reasonable. I usually spend about $20 for a full meal, including a bowl of rice (only $1 and refillable!). Plus, there’s no mandatory tip, which is great for anyone who eats out often.\nIf you want to experience how young Asians enjoy spicy food culture — and you can handle the heat — this is definitely the place to go! 🔥 Food: 5 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 3\n\nFood: 5\nService: 4\nAtmosphere: 3"

The food is priced by weight ($14.99/lb), and they even deduct the bowl’s weight before weighing, which makes it super fair. The soup base is free, and the staff are friendly and efficient.\nFor reference, if you cook at home, slices of meat usually costs around $4–8/lb, so the price here is reasonable. I usually spend about $20 for a full meal, including a bowl of rice (only $1 and refillable!). Plus, there’s no mandatory tip, which is great for anyone who eats out often.\nIf you want to experience how young Asians enjoy spicy food culture — and you can handle the heat — this is definitely the place to go! 🔥 Food: 5 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 3\n\nFood: 5\nService: 4\nAtmosphere: 3"

The food is priced by weight ($14.99/lb), and they even deduct the bowl’s weight before weighing, which makes it super fair. The soup base is free, and the staff are friendly and efficient.\nFor reference, if you cook at home, slices of meat usually costs around $4–8/lb, so the price here is reasonable.
